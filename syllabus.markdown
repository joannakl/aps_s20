# Prerequisites
---

- __Passing CSCI.UA.0201 with a grade of C or better.__
- __Passing CSCI.UA.0310 with a grade of C or better.__

- (You are expected to also know and remember the material from CSCI.UA.0101 and CSCI.UA.0102 courses.)




# Topics Covered (exact list of topics will depend on how quickly or slowly we will go through the material)
---

- programming basics: I/O, variable types and ranges
- time/space complexity analysis: estimate the execution time of a program
- fundamental data structures: array, linked list, stack, queue, binary search tree, hash table, heap/priority queue,
- tree data structures: union-find, trie
- problem solving strategies: complete search, greedy, binary/ternary search, divide-and-conquer
- decomposition and range queries: square-root/binary decomposition, segment tree, Fenwick tree, sparse table,
- graph algorithms: shortest path, topological sort, minimum spanning tree, Eulerian path/cycle, strongly connected components, articulation points & bridges
- dynamic programming (DP): subset sum, weight balancing, knapsack, longest common subsequence (LCS), edit distance, longest increasing subsequence (LIS), Hamiltonian path/cycle, DP state design and transition formulation
- string matching: Rabin-Karp, polynomial string hashing, KMP
- mathematics: prime, sieve of Eratosthenes, combinatorics, probability and expected value

# Grading  (exact grading rule subject to change by the beginning of the spring semester)
---

Your grade will be based on:

* exams (50%): a midterm exam (20%) and a final exam (30%) - the exams will be computer-based and given in class
* in-class/in-recitation quizzes (20%) - short paper-based and computer-based assessments
* homework (20%): most homework assignments will consist of a set of problems to be solved on your own
* recitations (10%): the participation and completion of work during the recitation sessions  - three lowest grades will be dropped to accommodate any excused or unexcused absences

Grades will be determined using the following scale:

        A   95-100
        A-  90-95
        B+  87-90
        B   83-87
        B-  80-83
        C+  76-80
        C   72-76
        D   65-72
        F   less than 65


The grade of *Incomplete* is reserved for students who, for legitimate and documented reason, miss the final exam. The grade of *Incomplete* **will not be given** to student who started falling behind in class. Those students should withdraw from the class or switch to *Pass/Fail* option.


# EXAMS
---
There will be a midterm and a final exam. All exams are cumulative.

__Missing an exam:__ There will be no make-up exams. Failure to take an exam counts as a zero grade on that exam. The only exception to this rule is for students who have a legitimate medical or personal emergency (documented). These students need to talk to the instructor as soon as possible (trying to excuse an exam absence a week after it happened will not work).


# Academic Integrity Policy
---

I follow the department's
[academic integrity rules](http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/academic_integrity).


I follow the department's
[academic integrity rules](http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/academic_integrity).

In short, it is fine to talk to other students about your ideas and your
programs, but it is not fine to work together on
assignments or copy someone else's assignment. You cannot copy other people's
work without giving them a proper credit (and
part of your grade).<br>
Any sharing or copying of assignments will be considered cheating.
By the rules of the College of Arts and Science, I am required to report any incidents of cheating to the department. <br>
If you have any doubt if something that you are doing qualifies as academic dishonesty, talk to me!
<br>

*So what is cheating?*

* Sharing code/solutions: by copying, retyping, looking at, or supplying a file (this includes posting partial or
complete solutions on the course discussion board, a public repository - think GitHub, or any place where others can access it)
* Coaching: helping your friend to write their code line by line (send
them to the tutors or office hours, if you want to help them)
* Copying code from previous course or from elsewhere on WWW.
    You are only allowed to use code from the textbook and what we supply on the course website.
* Hiring someone to complete your assignments for you.


*What is NOT cheating?*

* Explaining how to use systems or tools
* Helping others with high-level design issue



__You are responsible for thoroughly understanding every piece of code or algorithm that
you submit.__


# Academic Email Etiquette
---

* Check the school email address on a regular basis. You can simply forward its content
to another email account that you use regularly.

* Use your school's email account to send emails to professors, instructors, TA's, graders,
administrators, etc. OR make sure that your email address contains your true name,
not "frabjous@gmail.com", "BabyGurl@yahoo.com" or some other cool alias.

* Start your email with proper salutations! Use the correct titles (Professor, Dr., etc.)
and spell first and last names correctly. If you are on the first name basis with your instructors,
use their names, not "Hey". For example: "Dear Professor Drummer" or "Dear Robert", not "Hey Bob".

* Sign your name under the body of your email, otherwise you expect people to read emails from anonymous.

* Do not write everything in upper-case letters. Do not write everything in lower-case letters.

* Make sure you included everything you wanted before hitting send. Don't send three emails
one after another because you forgot something in the first one.

* Proofread the text in your email before sending it. Most of the email clients check for
typos, but they cannot tell if your email makes much sense. Read it, before you send it.
