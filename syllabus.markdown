# Topics Covered (exact list of topics will depend on how quickly or slowly we will go through the material)
---

- programming basics: I/O, variable types and ranges
- time/space complexity analysis: estimate the execution time of a program
- fundamental data structures: array, linked list, stack, queue, binary search tree, hash table, heap/priority queue,
- tree data structures: union-find, trie
- problem solving strategies: complete search, greedy, binary/ternary search, divide-and-conquer
- decomposition and range queries: square-root/binary decomposition, segment tree, Fenwick tree, sparse table,
- graph algorithms: shortest path, topological sort, minimum spanning tree, Eulerian path/cycle, strongly connected components, articulation points & bridges
- dynamic programming (DP): subset sum, weight balancing, knapsack, longest common subsequence (LCS), edit distance, longest increasing subsequence (LIS), Hamiltonian path/cycle, DP state design and transition formulation
- string matching: Rabin-Karp, polynomial string hashing, KMP
- mathematics: prime, sieve of Eratosthenes, combinatorics, probability and expected value

# Grading
---

Your course grade will be based on:

- exams, 25% (one midterm and one final exam) (see [Gradescope verdicts](problem_grading.html) for how the scores are computed)
- homework / weekly problem set, 60% (see [Gradescope verdicts](problem_grading.html) for how the scores are computed).
- online contest (6 problems), 15%

<!--
* exams (50%): a midterm exam (20%) and a final exam (30%) - the exams will be computer-based and given in class
* in-class/in-recitation quizzes (20%) - short paper-based and computer-based assessments
* homework (20%): most homework assignments will consist of a set of problems to be solved on your own
* recitations (10%): the participation and completion of work during the recitation sessions  - three lowest grades will be dropped to accommodate any excused or unexcused absences
-->


The letter grades will be determined using the following scale:

        A   95-100
        A-  90-95
        B+  87-90
        B   83-87
        B-  80-83
        C+  76-80
        C   72-76
        D   65-72
        F   less than 65


The grade of *Incomplete* is reserved for students who, for legitimate and documented reason, miss the final exam. The grade of *Incomplete* **will not be given** to student who started falling behind in class. Those students should withdraw from the class or switch to *Pass/Fail* option.


# Exams
---
There will be a midterm and a final exam. All exams are cumulative, timed and synchronous.

__Missing an exam:__ There will be no make-up exams. Failure to take an exam counts as a zero grade on that exam. The only exception to this rule is for students who have a legitimate medical or personal emergency (documented). These students need to talk to the instructor as soon as possible (trying to excuse an exam absence a week after it happened will not work).

# Homework / Weekly Problem Sets
---

Each week you will have a problem set to solve (4-5 problems of varying difficulty). Each problem set is weighted equally. No late submissions will be accepted for the homework problems.

# Online Contests
---

Throughout the semester we will let you know about various online contests. You need to participate in one
or more and submit passing solutions to six different problems (in a single contest or in multiple ones). Think of this as practice of your skills in the real world.

# Academic Integrity Policy
---

This course follows the university and departmental policies on academic integrity:
- [Academic Integrity for Students at NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/academic-integrity-for-students-at-nyu.html)
- [CS Department Academic Integrity](http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/academic_integrity)

Our main philosophy is that you need to be honest and fair to yourself, other students
in the class and the instructional stuff.

We know that interactions with your classmates can facilitate deeper understanding
of the subjects and provide invaluable lessons. But to benefit from those lessons
you need to be a participant in the team and not just a taker.

__All your work that is submitted for grading in this class has to be your own, unless
otherwise specified. You need to acknowledge any help that you receive on the assignments in your submissions.__

Here are examples of _fair_ and _not fair_ actions that a student may take. This is not an
exhaustive list and should serve as examples of behaviors rather than a complete
definition.

__Fair Actions__

- Working and solving a weekly problem set with other students AND writing the actual program
   on your own (you should acknowledge the names of all those involved in discussions)
- Discussing problem sets and assignments with the instructional stuff and
acknowledging such discussions in your submission.
- Incorporating a short fragment of code (a few lines) that you find in the course
suggested resources or other online resources and acknowledging it in your submission.
- Sharing code with others (possibly your classmates) that illustrates concepts
and techniques discussed in this course as long as this code is not a solution (or a partial solution)
to one of the assigned problems. (An example of such code would be routines that handle reading
from and writing to standard intput/output streams.)


__Not Fair Actions__

- Making your solutions available to others (publicly or privately). (This includes posting solution on a discussion forum, in a public repository, etc.).
- Asking a classmate to see their solutions prior to the last date at which submissions are
accepted (this may be different than the due date).
- Failing to acknowledge any form of help in the submission.
- Finding solutions to problems online and using them for your own submissions.
- Asking anybody (other than the instructional stuff) for help during an exam.
- Looking at another student's work during an exam.


# Academic Email Etiquette
---

* Check the school email address on a regular basis. You can simply forward its content
to another email account that you use regularly.

* Use your school's email account to send emails to professors, instructors, TA's, graders,
administrators, etc. OR make sure that your email address contains your true name,
not "frabjous@gmail.com", "BabyGurl@yahoo.com" or some other cool alias.

* Start your email with proper salutations! Use the correct titles (Professor, Dr., etc.)
and spell first and last names correctly. If you are on the first name basis with your instructors,
use their names, not "Hey". For example: "Dear Professor Drummer" or "Dear Robert", not "Hey Bob".

* Sign your name under the body of your email, otherwise you expect people to read emails from anonymous.

* Do not write everything in upper-case letters. Do not write everything in lower-case letters.

* Make sure you included everything you wanted before hitting send. Don't send three emails
one after another because you forgot something in the first one.

* Proofread the text in your email before sending it. Most of the email clients check for
typos, but they cannot tell if your email makes much sense. Read it, before you send it.
