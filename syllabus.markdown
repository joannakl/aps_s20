# Prerequisites
---

- __Passing CSCI.UA.0201 with a grade of C or better.__
You are expected to know and remember the material from CSCI.UA.0101 and CSCI.UA.0102 courses.


# Topics Covered (exact list of topics will depend on how quickly or slowly we will go through the material)
---

- programming basics: I/O, variable types and ranges
- time/space complexity analysis: estimate the execution time of a program
- fundamental data structures: array, linked list, stack, queue, binary search tree, hash table, heap/priority queue,
- tree data structures: union-find, trie
- problem solving strategies: complete search, greedy, binary/ternary search, divide-and-conquer
- decomposition and range queries: square-root/binary decomposition, segment tree, Fenwick tree, sparse table,
- graph algorithms: shortest path, topological sort, minimum spanning tree, Eulerian path/cycle, strongly connected components, articulation points & bridges
- dynamic programming (DP): subset sum, weight balancing, knapsack, longest common subsequence (LCS), edit distance, longest increasing subsequence (LIS), Hamiltonian path/cycle, DP state design and transition formulation
- string matching: Rabin-Karp, polynomial string hashing, KMP
- mathematics: prime, sieve of Eratosthenes, combinatorics, probability and expected value

# Grading  (exact grading rule subject to change by the beginning of the spring semester)
---

Your grade will be based on:

* exams (50%): a midterm exam (20%) and a final (30%),  
* homework (40%): each homework will consist of a set of problems to be solved on your own and
  an in-class quiz the following week (the quiz will count as 50% of the homework grade)  
* recitations (10%): the participation and completion of work during the recitation session

Grades will be determined using the following scale:

        A   95-100
        A-  90-95
        B+  87-90
        B   83-87
        B-  80-83
        C+  76-80
        C   72-76
        D   65-72
        F   less than 65


The grade of *Incomplete* is reserved for students who, for legitimate and documented reason, miss the final exam. The grade of *Incomplete* **will not be given** to student who started falling behind in class. Those students should withdraw from the class or switch to *Pass/Fail* option.


# EXAMS
---
There will be a midterm and a final exam. All exams are cumulative.

__Missing an exam:__ There will be no make-up exams. Failure to take an exam counts as a zero grade on that exam. The only exception to this rule is for students who have a legitimate medical or personal emergency (documented). These students need to talk to the instructor as soon as possible (trying to excuse an exam absence a week after it happened will not work).


# Academic Integrity Policy
---

I follow the department's
[academic integrity rules](http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/academic_integrity).

The nature of open source is based on collaborative work. But that work is still performed by individuals.
Your name should not be associated with a contribution that is not your own or that you have not put significant amount
of work into.



# Academic Email Etiquette
---

* Check the school email address on a regular basis. You can simply forward its content
to another email account that you use regularly.

* Use your school's email account to send emails to professors, instructors, TA's, graders,
administrators, etc. OR make sure that your email address contains your true name,
not "frabjous@gmail.com", "BabyGurl@yahoo.com" or some other cool alias.

* Start your email with proper salutations! Use the correct titles (Professor, Dr., etc.)
and spell first and last names correctly. If you are on the first name basis with your instructors,
use their names, not "Hey". For example: "Dear Professor Drummer" or "Dear Robert", not "Hey Bob".

* Sign your name under the body of your email, otherwise you expect people to read emails from anonymous.

* Do not write everything in upper-case letters. Do not write everything in lower-case letters.

* Make sure you included everything you wanted before hitting send. Don't send three emails
one after another because you forgot something in the first one.

* Proofread the text in your email before sending it. Most of the email clients check for
typos, but they cannot tell if your email makes much sense. Read it, before you send it.
