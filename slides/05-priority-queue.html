## Priority Queue

A __priority queue__ is a data structure that supports
- element insertion
- retrieval/access and removal of either minimum or maximum element
(depending on the type of the queue)


Functionally, it is similar to an ordinary queue in which the priorities
are determined based on the time of arrival of an element (first in first out).

In a priority queue, priorities associated with the elements determine the
next minimum or maximum element.

Multiple elements in a priority queue can have the same priority associated with them.

Priority queues are typically implemented using a _binary heap_ structure.

---
## Binary Heap / Priority Queue

A _binary heap_ is binary tree with two additional properties:

- shape property: it is a complete tree  (i.e., all levels are filled except for the lowest one, the
lowest one is filled from left to right)

- order property:  for each node the values of its children are
    - smaller than or equal to the one in the node (max-heap)
    - larger than or equal to the one in the node (min-heap)

--

Performance of the operations:
  - add $O(log N)$
  - remove $O(log N)$
  - top  $O(1)$

--

Building a heap from a collection of values is $O(N)$ !!!  Why?

---

## Building a Binary Heap in O(N)

Visualizations:

- [USFCA visualization](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Heap.html)
    - illustrates it with the worst case when the array is reverse sorted

- [VisuAlgo](https://visualgo.net/bn/heap)
    - allows you to customize the elements
    - has both $O(n \log n)$ and $O(N)$ processes illustrated


---
## Examples:

.left-column2-smaller[
in C++'s' `priority_queue` the defaul order of elements is "decreasing" (max-heap)

```C++
priority_queue<int> q;

q.push(3);
q.push(5);
q.push(7);
q.push(2);
cout << q.top() << "\n"; // 7
q.pop();
cout << q.top() << "\n"; // 5
```
To reverse the ordering of elements, instantiate `q` as

```C++
priority_queue<int,
        vector<int>,
        greater<int> >   q;
```

]
.right-column2-larger[
in Java's `PriorityQueue<>` the defaul order of elements is "increasing" (min-heap)

```Java
PriorityQueue<Integer> q =
  new PriorityQueue<Integer>();
q.add(3);
q.add(5);
q.add(7);
q.add(2);
System.out.println( q.peek() ); // 2
q.remove();
System.out.println( q.peek() );  // 3
```
.small[
To reverse the order of elements in `q`, define a `Comparator`

```java
class Comp implements Comparator<Integer>{
  public int compare (Integer a, Integer b) {
    return b-a;
  }
}
```

and then instantiate `q` as

```java
PriorityQueue<Integer> q =
  new PriorityQueue<Integer>(new Comp());
```

## Challenge

- Given `n` integers in arbitrary order find `k` largest ones.

- A basic max-heap  only supports element addition and removal of the max
element. How would you implement the following two operations:
  - `update(index, new_value)` - modify the value at a specified index to the new_value
  - `delete(index)` - deletes the value at a specified index

__Problem__:  Given $n$ integers in arbitrary order find `k` largest ones.

__Solution 4__:

- for i: k+1 to n
  - add the i'th element to a min-heap
  - remove the smallest element from the min-heap

- the values in the min-heap are the largest ones from the data set

## Median

__Problem 1__: Find the median

Given $n$ integers in arbitrary order find their median.

__Problem 2__: Find the running median

You are given a total of $n$ integers in arbitrary order. As you are reading
the values one by one, we want to know the value of the median for the values read in so far.

---

## Median - solutions

- use any of the k-largest values approach, but set k = n/2 (or adjust accordingly
for the even n) and only use the k'th value

- use two heaps: min-heap (stores values larger than the median) and max-heap
(stores values smaller than the median) -> median is always at the top of one
of the heaps (or the average of the two tops)

- use the median of median's algorithm (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_of_medians) or
an algorithms textbook)
