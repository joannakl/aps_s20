# Basic Linear Data Structures

- list
  - array
  - linked
- stack
- queue

--

Operations that determine performance of a data structure:

- insertion
- deletion
- query / find
- update / modify

--

__Data structures are separate from their implementations.__ For most there are many
different ways to implement them.

--

Most of the linear data structures are implemented in built-in libraries.

# List as a Static Array

_static array_ = fixed size, no need to resize it

- natively supported by both C/C++ and Java

- can be declared with appropriate size up-front if the problem specifies
the maximum input size (HINT: use extra buffer for safety to avoid
going out of bounds)

- can be multi-dimensional: 1D, 2D, 3D, ...

--

- allocated in memory as consecutive memory locations (important for fast accesses)

- assume that indexes in use are all in the front (starting at low indexes) and
there are no gaps

```
      -------------------------------------
      | 3 | 7 | -1| 0 | 15| -5|   |   |   |
      -------------------------------------
```

--

- performance of operations
  - insert/delete in the back O(1)
  - insert/delete in the front or _middle_ O(N)
  - update/modify O(???)
  - find O(???)

# List as a Static Array

__Java 1D and 2D static array__

```Java
int[] a;                       // declare the array
a = new int[n];                // create the array
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)    // elements are indexed from 0 to n-1
   a[i] = 1;                   // initialize all elements to 1
```
```Java
double[][] a;                   // declare a 2D array
a = new double[m][n];           // create a 2D array with m rows and n columns
for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)     // initialize all values to 0
   for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
      a[i][j] = 0;
```

__C/C++__

```C++
int a[n];                      // declare/create the array
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)    // elements are indexed from 0 to n-1
   a[i] = 1;                   // initialize all elements to 1
```

```C++
double a[m][n];                 // declare/create a 2D array with m rows and n columns
for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)     // initialize all values to 0
   for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
      a[i][j] = 0;
```

# List as a Dynamic/Resizable Array

- implementation provided by buil-in classes:
  - `vector` in C++ STL
  - `ArrayList` or `Vector` in Java (`ArrayList` is faster because it
  is unsynchronized)

- used when required size is not known at compile time

--

__performance of operations__

use __amortized analysis__: average/amortized performance of a sequence of operations
rather than each single operation <br>
reason ???

__performance of operations__

use __amortized analysis__: average/amortized performance of a sequence of operations
rather than each single operation <br>
reason: because this way the cost of a resize and copy of data is averaged
out <br>
(works only if resizing is done by multiplicative factor)

--

  - insert/delete in the back O(1)
  - insert/delete in the front or _middle_ O(N)
  - update/modify: using index O(1), if need to find, then see below
  - find O(N) if not sorted, O(logN) if sorted

---
# List as a Linked Structure
## (a Linked List)


- implementation provided by buil-in classes:
  - `list` in C++ STL
  - `LinkedList`  in Java

- rarely used due to poor performance of accessing elements

- (good exercise: implement your own in both Java and C++ to
practice reference/pointer operations)

- performance of operations
  - insert/delete in the back/front O(1) (assume a doubly linked)
  - insert/delete in the _middle_ O(N)
  - update/modify: O(N) (except for in the front/back)
  - find O(N)


---

# List _Hybrids_

- dynamically allocated list that consists of short fixed sized arrays that
are connected into a linked list

- linked list in which the "links" are provided by indexes in a separate
array

# Challenge

.left-column2[
Given a `head` pointer/reference to a singly linked list, determine if it has a loop.

Determine the length of the loop if it exists.

Restrictions:
- Elements in the list are not unique.
- Do not use extra storage.

__Solution__ Rabbit and Turtle (two pointers)
- start two pointers at head
- advance rabbit two steps per iteration
- advance turtle one step per iteration
- if they meet (i.e., rabbit does not find the end of the list)
then there is a loop and a note at which they meet is somewhere on the loop
- trace through the loop with one of them to determine the number of nodes in
the loop
]

# Challenge


- Can a singly linked list be circular?

# Stacks

---
# Stack (first in last out, FILO)


- implementation provided by buil-in classes:
  - `stack` in C++ STL
  - `Stack`  in Java

--

- operations performed
    - add/push O(1) - adds to the top
    - remove/pop O(1) - removes from the top
    - top O(1) - access the element on the top (optional)
    - empty O(1) - determine if the stack is empty (optional)

--

- used in many algorithms for solving problems
  - postfix, prefix calculations and conversions
  - graph algorithms

# Challenge: Brackets Matching

Given a mathematical expression containing parentheses, i.e., `(` and `)`, determine if the
expression is valid.

Example:

`()(())` => valid

`)()(())(` => invalid

`()()(` => invalid


--

------

- Can you solve it without using any data structures (i.e., no stack)?

--

- Can you solve it for different types of brackets in a single expression?

  `{()()}[(())]` => valid

  `{)()(]` => invalid

  `(){(})` => invalid

---

# Challenge: Brackets Matching

__Solution with one kind of brackets__:

- keep an integer that starts at zero
- for each opening bracket increment it
- for closed bracket decrement it (if less than zero, INVALID)

if the value at the end is zero, then VALID, otherwise INVALID

--

__Solution for mixed brackets__:

- keep a stack of characters
- for each opening brackets, push it on the stack
- for each closing bracket,
  - if matches top of the stack, then pop the stack
  - otherwise, INVALID  (this covers empty stack as well)

if the stack is empty, then VALID, otherwise INVALID


--

__What is the time complexity of these algorithms?__

--

- Linear in the length of the input string expression.

# Evaluating Mathematical Expressions

Evaluate an arithmetic expression with only operators and numbers:

- `1 + 2 + 3    =>  6`
- `1 + 2 * 3    =>  7`
- `1 * 2 * 3    =>  6`
- `1 * 2 + 3    =>  5`

--

Do the same with added parenthesis:

- `1 + 2 * 3    =>  7`
- `(1 + 2) * 3    =>  9`
- `1 * 2 + 3    =>  5`
- `1 * (2 + 3)    =>  6`

--

The code that can evaluate such expressions has to:
- find and evaluate all subexpressions
- for each operator figure out what its operands are

It is easier if we can ignore the parenthesis and not have to
worry about the operator precedence.

---

# Prefix  and Postfix Notations
### (a.k.a. Polish and Reverse Polish Notation)

__Infix notation__ is a notation for writing human readable arithmetic
expressions in which the operator appears _in-between_ its operands.

[__Prefix notation__](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation)
is a notation for writing arithmetic expressions in
which the operator comes _before_ its operands.

[__Postfix notation__](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation)
is a notation for writing arithmetic expressions in
which the operator comes _after_ its operands.

| infix          | prefix           | postfix      |
| :--------------| :--------------- | :----------- |
| `2 + 5`        |  `+ 2 5`         | ` 2 5 + `    |
| `(2 + 4) * 5`  | `* + 2 4 5`      | ` 2 4 + 5 *` |
| `2 + 4 * 5`    |  `+ 2 * 4 5`     | ` 2 4 5 * +` |

---

# Evaluate Prefix Expressions


- scan the given prefix expression from right to left
- for each token in the input prefix expression
  - if the token is an operand then
      - push onto a stack
  - else if the token is an operator then
      - operand1 = pop stack
      - operand2 = pop stack
      - compute operand1 operator operand2
      - push result onto stack
- return top of stack as result

---

# Evaluate Postfix Expressions


- scan the given postfix expression from left to right
- for each token in the input postfix expression
  - if the token is an operand
      - push it (its value) onto a stack
  - else if the token is an operator
      - operand2 = pop stack       (!!!)
      - operand1 = pop stack
      - compute operand1 operator operand2
      - push result onto stack
- return top of the stack as result

---
# Convert Infix to Postfix

- for each character in the input infix string expression
  - if the character is an operand
      - append to postfix string expression
  - else if the character is a left brace
      - push it onto the operator stack
  - else if the character is an operator
      - if the stack is not empty
          - while top element on the stack has higher precedence
              - pop the stack and append to postfix string expression
      - push it (the current operator) onto the operator stack
  - else if the character is a right brace
      - while the operator stack is not empty
          - if the top of the operator stack is not a matching left brace
              - pop the operator stack and append to postfix string expression
          - else
              - pop the left brace and discard
              - break
- while the operator stack is not empty
  - pop the operator stack and append to postfix string expression

---
# Exercise

Apply the infix to postfix conversion to the following expression:
$$4 + (5 * 6) / (1 + 2 + 3) $$

Show the content of the operator stack and the postfix expression after each
iteration of the outermost for loop.

--

You should end up with `4 5 6 * 1 2 + 3 + / +`.
