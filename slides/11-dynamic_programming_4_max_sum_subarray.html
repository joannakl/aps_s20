## Challenge: # Max Sum Subarray

In computer science, the maximum sum subarray problem is the task of finding a contiguous subarray wit
h the largest sum, within a given one-dimensional array A[1...n] of numbers.

Formally, the task is to find indices i and j with 1 <= i <= j <= n, such that the sum

a[i] + a[i+1] + ... + a[j-1] + a[j]

is as large as possible.

For example, for the array of values [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4], the contiguous subarray with the
 largest sum is [4, -1, 2, 1], with sum 6.

Write a program to calculate such sum with given input array.

__Input__

The first line contains 1 integer n, the number of elements in the input array. 1 <= n <= 100000.

In the next line, there are n integer indicating the elements of the array. We have $-10^9 <= A[i] <= 
10^9$ for $1 <= i <= n$.

__Output__

Output one line containing the value of the sum for the  maximum subarray.


__Example 1__

```
Input:
9
-2 1 -3 4 -1 2 1 -5 4

Output:
6

```

__Example 2__

```
Input:
4
-3 -2 -4 -1

Output:
-1
```

---

## Greedy Approach 

__Idea / Algorithm__

- Start a sum. 
- Keep adding numbers as long as they are positive. 
- As soon as you hit a negative number, stop the current subarray (and record its sum) and start a new subarray, because a negative number will only make the sum smaller.

--

__This does not work.__ The last statement fails.

Example

`A = [10, -2, 10]`

The largest sum is 18 when we take all the values. But the above algorithm would report 10 as the max sum. 


---

## Brute Force - Take 1

This is the most straightforward, but also the slowest, approach.


__Idea__
Iterate through every possible pair of start, `i`, and end, `j` indices.
For each pair, iterate from i to j to calculate the sum of that subarray.

--

__Algorithm__

```
best = - INF 

for i in 0 .. N
    for j in i+1 .. N
        sum = 0
        for k in i .. j 
            sum = sum + A[k]
        if sum > best 
            best = sum 
return best 
```
--

__Complexity__ $O(N^3)$


## Brute Force - Take 2

We can improve the previous solution:

While iterating through all start, `i`, and end, `j` indices, we can avoid the third loop by keeping a running sum.

--



__Algorithm__

```
best = - INF 

for i in 0 .. N
    sum = 0 
    for j in i+1 .. N
        sum = sum + A[j] 
        if sum > best 
            best = sum 
return best 

```
--

__Complexity__ $O(N^2)$


--

Are there any further optimizations to this algorithm? 

---

## Divide and Conquer 


__Idea__  Use an approach similar to merge sort. 

The maximum subarray for a given array `A[i...j]` can be in one of three places:

- in the left half `A[i...mid]`

- in the right half `A[mid+1...j]

- spanning the midpoint (a subarray that starts in the left half and ends in the right half).

--

```

A[0...n-1] - the given array 

maxSubarra(i, j)  - computes the max subarray between indexes i and j



maxSubArray(i, j):
    if i == j:
        return A[i]                  // only one element

    mid = (i + j) / 2

    // solve in left and right halves
    leftMax  = maxSubArray(i, mid)
    rightMax = maxSubArray(mid + 1, j)

    // compute best suffix of left half
    sum = 0
    bestLeftMiddle = -INF
    for l from mid down to i:
        sum += A[l]
        bestLeftMiddle = max(bestLeftMiddle, sum)

    // compute best prefix of right half
    sum = 0
    bestRightMiddle = -INF
    for r from mid + 1 up to j:
        sum += A[r]
        bestRightMiddle = max(bestRightMiddle, sum)

    crossMax = bestLeftMiddle + bestRightMiddle

    return max(leftMax, rightMax, crossMax)


```



## Max Sum Subarray

### Greedy Attempt Fails

__Idea__: Go through each garment and pick the most expensive item within the
remaining budget.

__Problem__: Each decision influences the possible future decisions, making some of them impossible.
In many cases, this approach will lead to wrong answers (sub-optimal solution or no solution).


__Example__:

M = 12, C = 3:

```
3:   6 4 8
2:   5 10
4:   1 5 3 5
```

Greedy approach picks 8 for the first garment, and returns no solution since
the remaining budget of 4 does not allow us to pick anything else.

Optimal solution picks 6, 5, 1 and uses the entire budget.


__BUT__ greedy approach works for the original example when the budget was 20.


---
## Max Sum Subarray

### Divide and Conquer

Subproblems (selecting of each type of the garment) are not independent - the
solution depends on the choices made for other subproblems.

The divide and conquer approach is not suitable here.



---
## Max Sum Subarray

### Complete Search / Recursive Backtracking

Algorithm:

- start with money $m=M$ and garment category $i=0$,
- $shop( m, i )$ - returns the largest amount that can be spent assuming we have the available
amount of money $m$ and categories $i..C$ to chose from

```
shop( m, i )

    if m < 0  return -INF          //run out of money
    if i == C return (M - m)       //finished and spent M-m

    best = -1
    for g in  0 .. count[i]
        best  =  max ( best,  shop(m - price[i][g], i+1) )

    return best
```
<br/>

--

Produces correct answer, but slow
- in the largest case, each garment category has 20 different items and
there are 20 garment categories
- this gives $20^{20}$ recursive calls to solve the sub-problems
in the worst case - too many



---
## Max Sum Subarray



But, the good news is that some of those $20^{20}$ subproblems are overlapping and
we really have many fewer unique subproblems to solve.
--

- if any garment category has more than one item with the same price, then the two
subproblems (selecting one or the other of the garments) are the same, example:
    ```
    C = 3:

    3:   6 1 8
    3:   5 10 5
    4:   1 5 3 5
    ```
    selecting either of the 5's in the second row, will lead to the same solutions
--

-  at the time that we look at garment cagory i, we might be starting with the same
amount of money even though we made different choices in the previous categories,  example:
    ```
    C = 3:

    3:   6 1 8
    3:   5 10 5
    4:   1 5 3 5
    ```
    selecting either 6 and 5, or 1 and 10 will lead to the same _best_ option for
    the last row (in both cases, we already spend 11 out of the budget)


---
## Max Sum Subarray

.small[
consider the following functions and quantities
- $shop(m, i)$, $0 <= m <= M$ and $0 <= i <= C$ <br>
returns the amount of money we can spend using `m` dollars for the
garments in categories `i, i+1, ..., C-1`

- $p[i][g]$ is the price of garment g in garment category i

- $count[i]$ is the number of garments in garment category i
]

--

then the following are true

- if $m < 0$, then $shop(m, i) = -\infty$

- if $i == C$ (an item in last garment category has been purchased), then
$shop(m,i) = M-m$

- for all other cases, <br>

  $$shop(m, i) = \max_{g=0}^{count[i]}{ shop(m - p[i][g], i+1)}$$

--

In this problem, there are
- 201 options for M (since `0 <= M <= 200`)
- 20 options for item category (since `1 <= C <= 20`)

so there are 201*20 = 4020 possible subproblems (in the worst case).

    if answer[m][i] != -1   return answer[m][i]

        best  =  max ( best,  shop(m - price[i][g], i+1) )

## Wedding Shopping with DP (bottom-up)

```
answer = an M+1 by C 2D array initialized to -1

shop( M )

    //populate the table with values from the first category
    for g in  0 .. count[0]
        answer[ price[0][g] ][i] = price[0][g]

    //populate the remaining categories
    for i in 1 .. C-1
        for m  in  0 .. M
            if answer[m][i-1] != -1
                for g in 0 .. count[i]
                    answer[ m + price[i][g] ][i] = m + price[i][g]    <<<<

    // find the highest price in the bottom row of the table
    for m in M .. 1
