## Online Contest (6 problems)

.small[
Throughout the semester we will let you know about various online contests.
You need to participate in one or more and submit passing solutions to six
different problems (in a single contest or in multiple ones).

- ICPC Practice contests
- Codeforces
- ...
]

--

If you know of any upcoming contests, make a post of Ed and we
will verify if this is an acceptable contest to satisfy this requirement.

--


When you successfully solve a problem:
- make a post on Ed using "Online Contests" category
- include a link to the problem description that you successfully solved
- include a screenshot showing that your solution was accepted
- create a runnable code block with your solution so other people
can see it and test it out

If you solve more than one problem in a single contest, make multiple posts.

These posts should be made within one week of contest completion
(not on the last day of classes!).
BUT wait till the contest is over before posting your solutions.
