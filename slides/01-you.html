# Why are you here in APS?

--

- develop problem-solving skills, 
- understand and use algorithms, 
- communicate solutions effectively

--

__How do you plant to accomplish these goals?__

# What role should generative AI play in your learning? 

---

### What are some advantages of using it in a class (this or any other)?

--


1. **Speed and Efficiency:**
   - **Pro:** Generative AI tools can provide quick solutions to algorithmic problems, potentially saving time and helping students to see different approaches or get unstuck when they are facing challenges.

2. **Exposure to Diverse Techniques:**
   - **Pro:** AI tools might expose students to a variety of problem-solving techniques and algorithms they might not have encountered yet. This could enhance their understanding of different approaches and solutions.

3. **Supplementary Learning Resource:**
   - **Pro:** When used appropriately, AI tools can serve as supplementary resources to help students understand complex problems and learn how different algorithms are applied.



---

### What are some disadvantages of using it in a class (this or any other)?

--

1. **Hinders Skill Development:**
   - **Con:** Relying on AI-generated solutions can impede the development of critical problem-solving skills. Students may miss out on 
   the deeper learning that comes from grappling with problems and developing solutions independently.

2. **Lack of Understanding:**
   - **Con:** If students use AI to generate solutions without understanding the underlying principles, they may struggle to communicate their solutions effectively or explain their reasoning during discussions or presentations.

3. **Academic Integrity:**
   - **Con:** Using AI tools to produce solutions may breach academic integrity policies. This could be considered a form of academic dishonesty 
   if it involves presenting AI-generated work as oneâ€™s own, which undermines the value of the educational experience.

4. **Over-reliance on Technology:**
   - **Con:** Students might become over-reliant on technology for problem-solving, which could limit their ability to think critically and 
   solve problems without technological aid. This dependency can be detrimental in scenarios where AI tools are not available.

5. **Misalignment with Learning Objectives:**
   - **Con:** The use of generative AI tools may misalign with the course's learning objectives, which are likely focused on developing algorithmic thinking, 
   problem-solving skills, and effective communication. Relying on AI tools may detract from achieving these goals.

### How do you feel about students submitting assignments that were generated by an AI system and getting full score on them? 


---

# Generative AI and this class

- Use it to learn! not to quickly score points!

	- Work on your own solution/approach (or preferably come up with several) and then study solutions that are generated by an AI system. 
How do they compare? Did AI come up with some ideas that you missed, or the other way around? Are all solutions correct? Do they have similar performance? 
What are benefits and dwabacks of each? 

- __Any solution that you submit for grading has to be your own (not generated by an AI, or copied from solutions found elsewhere).__


- If you get help from anybody or anything in solving the problem (be it an idea for the solution, parts of the solution, or anything 
that is not just a lookup into the documentation), then
credit your sources clearly at the top of the submitted file.
