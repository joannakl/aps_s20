## Complete Search

<br><br><br>
- a.k.a., __brute force__
<br><br>
- solving problems by traversing the entire (or a large part of) search space
in order to find the desired solution

- recursive backtracking solutions fall under this category

## Challenge: Digit Quotient

__Task__

Find all pairs of 5-digit numbers that collectively use all 10 digits 0 - 9 once each,
such that the first number divided by the second number is equal to a given integer N,
where $2 <= N <= 79$.

$$ abcde / fghij = N $$

(The first digit of one of the numbers could be zero.)

__Example__:

N = 62

79546 / 01283

94736 / 01528

## Challenge: Digit Quotient

__Observation__

- `fghij` can range from `01234` to `98765` <br>
   or, even better from  `01234` to `(98765/N)`

- given `fghij` we can compute `abcde` as `fghij*N`

__Questions__

- given two values `tmp1` and `tmp2`, how can be decide if they use all ten digits

--

__Solution__


input: N

```
for fghij in 1234 to 98765/N :
    abcde = fghij * N
    check if abcde and fghij collectively use 10 digits
    if they do
        print the values of the two numbers
```

---
template: challenge

## Challenge: Digit Quotient

to check if `abcde` and `fghij` use all 10 digits

- set `used_digits` to (`fghij` < 1000) - this will set the last bit of `used_digits`
to 1 if the `f` digit is zero
- set tmp to `abcde`
- while tmp > 0
    - `used_digits` |= 1 << (tmp%10)
    - tmp /= 10
- set tmp to `fghij`
- while tmp > 0
    - `used_digits` |= 1 << (tmp%10)
    - tmp /= 10
- if (used_digits == (1 << 10) - 1)
    - all digits are used

## Challenge: Solving Equations

Given three integers A, B, C ($1 <= A,B,C <= 10000$) find three other distict values
X, Y, Z such that:

$$X + Y + Z = A$$
$$X \times Y \times Z = B$$
$$X^2 + Y^2 + Z^2 = C$$

__Example__:

A = 6 <br>
B = 6 <br>
C = 14 <br>

then x = 1, y = 2, z = 3 is a solution


--

__Observation__

the possible values of x, y and z are in $[-100, 100]$

- how do we know that?

--

- since in $X^2 + Y^2 + Z^2 = C$, $C$ can be at most 10,000, none of the values
can exceed 100 in absolute value

## Challenge: Solving Equations

__Algorithm__

Give: values of A, B, C

```
for x in -100 .. 100
  for y in -100 .. 100
    for z in -100 .. 100
       if x, y and x are all different
          AND x + y + z = A
          AND x * y * z = B
          AND x*x + y*y + z*z = C
              we have a solution

```

__Can we eliminate some of the steps?__

## Challenge: Solving Equations


Can we eliminate some of the steps?
- because of the second equation, we know that at least of of the above loops
has a range of no more than -22 to 22 (since if all values were x=y=z=22,
we would have 22^3>10,000 and 21^3 < 10,000)
- in each loop we can check if the value is not equal to already used value
- for each loop we can check if the current variables (ignoring the contributions from the next one) are able
to satisfy the conditions of the three equations


```
for x in -22 .. 22
  if x * x <= C
    for y in -100 .. 100
      if y != x AND x * x + y * y <= C
        for z in -100 .. 100
           if x, y and x are all different
              AND x + y + z = A
              AND x * y * z = B
              AND x*x + y*y + z*z = C
                  we have a solution

```

## A few problems


- Given an array of numbers, is it possible to split them values into two groups (all values have to be used),
so that sum of one group is a multiple of 10 and sum of the other group is odd?

- Given an array of numbers and a target value, is it possible to pick values from the
array that add up to the target?
  - Added restriction 1: all occurences of 5 must be picked.
  - Added restriction 2: if a value is picked, niether of the values adjacent to it can be picked.
  - Added restriction 3: report all posible ways in which such a sum can be produced.

- Given an alphabet, generate all strings of length S (letters can repeat)
  - Added restriction 1: generate only strings that contain `en` as the last two characters
    (assume that the letters `e` and `n` are in the alphabet)
  - Added restriction 2: generate only strings that are valid words in a given dictionary

## Queens on a Chess Board

__Task__ Place 8 queens on an 8x8 chess board so that no two
queens attack one another.

--

__Solution 1__ (most naive) <br>
- enumarate all combinations of 8 different cells out of the
64 possibilities and see which of them provide a solution  <br>
performance: $~_{64}C_8 \approx 4 \text{billion}$

--

__Solution 2__ (still naive, but a bit faster) <br>
- observation: each queen has to be in its own column
- for each column, pick a single row position <br>
performance: $8^8 \approx 17 \text{million}$

--

__Solution 3__ (a bit faster than the previous one) <br>
- observation: each queen has to be in its own column and its own row
- for each column, pick a single row position that is not
equal to any previously chosen row<br>
performance: $8! \approx 40 \text{thousand}$

## Queens on a Chess Board
## Backtracking

__Solution 4__ (getting there)

- observation 1: each queen has to be in its own
    - column
    - row
    - diagonal
- observation 2: no point in continuing to generate solutions that violate
one of the above conditions (this gives us backtracking: prune
the paths that do not lead to a valid solution)

performance: $\text{sub} O(n!)$ where $n$ is the size of the chessboard
(= number of queens)


_See [handout](08/queens_1.pdf) for the implementation._

---

## Queens on a Chess Board
## Backtracking

- With 8 queens on an 8x8 chessboard
we have under $8! \approx 40 \text{thousand}$ operations.

- If each operation takes $\approx 10^{-8}$ seconds, than this
algorithm completes in under a second for 8 queens.

--

- What happens if you use a larger chessboard (i.e. larger number of queens)?
for example $n=14$

---

## Making the _complete search_ work

- filter vs. generate  <br>
generate all possible solutions rather than starting with a set of all options
and removing the impossible one

- prune infeasible search space areas as soon as possible

- pre-calculate and store results that may need to be used again (trade
memory for time)

- optimize your source code:
    - code in C++, not Java â˜¹
    - use efficient i/o routines (`scanf/printf` over `cin/cout` in C++
      `BufferedReader/BufferedWriter` over `Scanner/System.out` in Java)
    - use cache friendly algorithms: consecutive memory accesses in an array
      rather than jumping around
    - access 2D arrays in a row major order
    - use `int/long` or `bitset/Bitset` for manipulating boolean data, not
    arrays or vectors of boolean variables
    - use an array over `Vector/ArrayList`
    - declare large data structures and objects once and reuse them
    - use iterative implementation over recursive implementations (assuming
    same level of difficulty in coding)
    - use c-string instead of C++ `string` class; use `StringBuffer` instead
      of `String` class in Java
