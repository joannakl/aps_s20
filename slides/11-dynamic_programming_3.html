## Knapsack

__Task__: Given $n$ items, each with its own value $V_i$ and its own weight/size $W_i$,
and a maximum knapsack size $S$, find the maximum value of the items that can be
placed into the knapsack. (Each item can be either taken or left - we cannot
take part of an item.)


--

__Example__

n = 4

V = {100, 70, 50, 10}

W = {10, 4, 6, 12}

S = 12

Possible options:
- item 0, total weight 10, total value 100
- items 1 and 2, total weight 10, total value 120
- item 3, total weight 12, total value 10

---

## Knapsack  - Algorithm



`max_val ( item_number, remaining_weight)` - function that returns the maximum value
of items given that we have the `remaining_weight` available and the current item we
are considering is `item_number`

__simple cases__ / __base_cases__

`max_val ( id, 0 ) = 0  // we cannot take any more items`

`max_val ( n, rem_W ) = 0  // went past the item with the highest id`

__reucrrence ralation__

```
if W[id] < remW
  max_val(id, remW) = max_val (id+1, remW )  //don't take the item since it is too heavy
else
  max_val(id, remW) = max (
                        max_val (id+1, remW - W[id]),   //take the item
                        max_val (id+1, remW )          //do NOT take the item
                          )

## Cutting Sticks

__Task:__ Given a stick of length 1 <= l <= 1000, and 1<=n <= 50 cuts to be made to the stick
(coordinates of the cuts are values in the range [0 .. l]) figure out the most _affordable__ way
of cutting the stick. The cost of a cut is determined by the length of the stick to be
cut.

--

__Example __

l = 100

n = 3

The cut coordinates are A = {25, 50, 75}

Possible sequences of cuts:

- left to right at positions 25, 50, 75, cost = 100 + 75 + 50 = 225
- right to left at positions 75, 50, 25, cost = 100 + 75 + 50 = 225
- first cut in the middle, then each half-stick in the middle again at mostions 50, 25, 75,
cost = 100 + 50 + 50 = 200
