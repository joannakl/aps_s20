# Queues

---
# Queues (first in first out, FIFO)


- implementation provided by buil-in classes:
  - `queue` in C++ STL
  - `Queue`  in Java (note that this is an interface that
  is implemented by several different classes in Java)

--

- operations performed
    - add/enqueu/push O(1) - adds to the back of the queue
    - remove/dequeue/pop O(1) - removes from the front of the queue
    - empty O(1) - determine if the stack is empty (optional)



---

# Array as an Efficient Queue

--

- keep track of front (first element) and back (last element)
.center[<img src="img/queue_array_1.PNG" alt="queue array" width = "50%"/>]


--

- what do we do if the back reaches the end of the array?
.center[<img src="img/queue_array_2.PNG" alt="queue array back at end" width = "50%"/>]
--

use a circular array (and modular arithmetic) to rotate and move back
to the beginning of the array (low indexes)
.center[<img src="img/queue_array_3.PNG" alt="queue array back at end" width = "50%"/>]

---

# Array as an Efficient Queue



- how do we distinguish between an empty and full queue? (what should
be the values of front and back _pointers_ for an empty queue?)


.left-column2[<img src="img/queue_array_4.PNG" alt="queue array back at end" width = "80%"/>

When the last element is removed, the front moves in front of the back. But this is also the
case for the full array.

.below-column2[
- Keep track of the number of elements in the queue.

- Allocate large enough array that full never happens.

# Deque
## (= double ended queue)

---
# Deque


- implementation provided by buil-in classes:
  - `deque` in C++ STL
  - `Deque`  in Java (note that this is an interface that
  is implemented by several different classes in Java)

--

- operations performed
    - push front, push back O(1) - add to either end of the deque
    - pop front, pop back O(1) - remove from either end of the deque
    - empty O(1) - determine if the deque is empty (optional)

# Challenge: Smallest So Far

Given a list of N positive integers (1 <= N <= $10^6$), compute for each
element A[i], what is the smallest element to its left (excluding itself).

Sample Input Array:


```
         -----------------------------
  array: | 5 | 4 | 8 | 3 | 9 | 2 | 10|
         -----------------------------
```

Smallest to the Left Array:

```
         -----------------------------
  array: | --| 5 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 2 |
         -----------------------------
```

---
class: challenge

## Possible solutions

__First Attempt__

- for every element A[i] check all the elements to its left
  - brute force  $\rightarrow$ time $O(N^2)$

------

--


__Second Attempt__

__Obeservation__: the sequence of the "smallest to the left" is monotonically
decreasing

Assume
  - $A$ is the given array
  - $STL$ is the array of smallest to the left that we are generating

Calculate STL as follows:
- $STL[0]$ is undefined (since there is nothing to the left of $A[0]$)
- $STL[1] = A[0]$ (since that is the only value to the left)
- $STL[i] = min( A[i-1], STL[i-1] )$, for $i > 1$

This is $O(N)$

# Challenge: Smaller than Current

Given a list of N positive integers (1 <= N <= $10^6$), compute for each
element A[i], what is the __rightmost__ element to its left that is
strictly smaller than A[i].


.left-column2[
Sample Input Array:


```
         -----------------------------
  array: | 5 | 4 | 8 | 3 | 9 | 2 | 10|
         -----------------------------
```
Rightmost Smaller Solution Array:

```
         -----------------------------
  array: | --| --| 4 | --| 3 | --| 2 |
         -----------------------------
```
]
.right-column2[
Sample Input Array:


```
         -----------------------------
  array: | 1 | 4 | 6 | 13| 6 | 19| 10|
         -----------------------------
```
Rightmost Smaller Solution Array:

```
         -----------------------------
  array: | --| 1 | 4 | 6 | 4 | 6 | 6 |
         -----------------------------
```

class: challenge

.left-column2[
## First Attempt

- for every element A[i] check all the elements to its left
(preferably starting from A[i] and scanning towards low indexes)
  - brute force  $\rightarrow$ time $O(N^2)$


But what is the actual algorithm for doing this?

------

]
--
.right-column2[

Assume
  - $A$ is the given array
  - $RST$ is the array of rightmost smaller than values


__Question__: How far down the array do we need to go to find an answer for A[i]?

  - j: from i-1 down to 0
    - if $A[j] > A[i]$, continue
    - if $A[j] == A[i]$, then $RST[i] = RST[j]$ is the answer
    - if $A[j] < A[i]$, then  $RST[i] = A[j]$ is the answer (and we break from the loop)
  - if $RST[i]$ is still not set, then it is undefined

This has to be repeated for each A[i]


]

What happens with this array?

```
         -----------------------------
         | 1 | 10| 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 |
         -----------------------------
```

and this?

```
         -----------------------------
         | 1 | 10| 9 | 2 | 7 | 6 | 5 |
         -----------------------------
```

--

__Observation__ spans of monotonically decreasing values larger
than a current value, cannot contain the answer.

---
class: challenge

## Second Attempt

- RST[0] = undefined
- stack.push(A[i])
- i: 1 to N-1
  - while stack not empty and top of the stack >= A[i]
      - pop the stack
  - if stack is empty, set RST[i] to undefined
  - else set RST[i] to the top of the stack (do not pop it)
  - push A[i] onto the stack


--

.left-column2[
Let's apply it to


```
  -----------------------------
  | 1 | 4 | 6 | 13| 6 | 19| 10|
  -----------------------------
```
]

--

.right-column2[

| A[i] | stack before | RST[i] | stack after |
|:---:|:---|:---:|:---|
| 1  | | -- |1  |
| 4 | 1 | 1 | 1 4 |
| 6 | 1 4 | 4| 1 4 6 |
| 13 | 1 4 6 | 6 | 1 4 6 13 |
|6 | 1 4 ~~6 13~~| 4 | 1 4 6|
| 19 | 1 4 6 | 6 | 1 4 6 19 |
| 10 | 1 4 6 ~~19~~ | 6 | 1 4 6 |

What is the performance of this algorithm?

--

$O(N)$

--

What are good test cases for this problem?

class:on_your_own

# OnYourOwn: Modified Stack

__Task:__ Implement a stack that supports $O(1)$ operations for push, pop, top,
__AND__ getMin (finds the smallest value in the current stack).

--

Hint 1: use a stack to keep track of the smallest element(s).

--

Hint 2: does your algorithm work if we allow duplicate values in the stack?
