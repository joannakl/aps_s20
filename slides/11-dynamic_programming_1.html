## Dynamic Programming

__Dynamic programming__ is a technique of solving problems by means of breaking a larger
problem into smaller/simpler sub-problems.

Dynamic programming solutions gain their speed over the complete-search types of problem solving
techniques by making sure that each sub-problem is solved only once and the result
is stored for reuse later one.

## Fibonacci Numbers - A Familiar Classic

Here is one way to compute Fibonacci Numbers:

```
int fib ( int N ) {
  if N <= 1
    return N
  return fib (N-1) + fib(N+2)
}
```
--

So what is wrong with that implementation? <br>
(afterall we learned this in cs101/cs102)

--

It computes the value of each Fibonacci number multiple times!

---

## Fibonacci Numbers with Memoization

Let's use a memo table to _remember_ the values that were previously computed


```
  int memo[MAX_N];
  for i in 0 ... MAX_N:
    memo [i] = -1;

  int fib ( int N ) {
    if memo[N] != -1
        return memo[N]
    if N <= 1
        return N
    memo[N] = fib (N-1) + fib(N+2)
    return memo[N]
  }
```

--

This is a top-down approach that parallels the recursive approach from the previous
slide, but its efficiency is MUCH MUCH better since it never computes
the same value again.

---
## Fibonacci Numbers - Bottom-Up

Calculate all Fibonacci numbers from 0 to N, O(n) memory

```
int fib[MAX_N]

void fib_all ( int N ) {
  fib[0] = 0
  fib[1] = 1
  for i in 2 ... N:
    fib[i] = fib[i-1] + fib[i-2]
}
```
--

Calculate the N'th Fibonacci number, O(1) memory


```
int fib ( int N ) {
  if N <= 1
      return N
  int prev1 = 0
  int prev2 = 1
  for i in 2 ... N:
    int next = prev1 + prev2
    prev2 = prev1
    prev1 = next
  return prev1
}
```
---
## Fibonacci Numbers

- behind all of these aproaches there is the same recurrence relation:
    $$ fib(i) = fib(i-1) + fib(i-2) $$

- two approaches to solution:

    - __top-down__
        - start from the desired value, fib(N)
        - follows its dependencies based on the recurrence ration
        - use memoization to avoid recomputation

    - __bottom-up__
        - start from the _bottom level_ of dependencies (the base cases, the boundaries)
        - follow the recurrence relation till the desired value is calculated, fib(N)
        - (no need for memoization table, unless all values along the way are required)

---
## Generalization to <br>Dynamic Programming

1. Figure out the recurrence raltion

1. Use top-down with memoization or bottom-up computation to avoid recomputation of values.

## Making Change
---

## Making change - revisited

__Task__: Given a set of coin denominations construct a given value using as
few coins as possible.

- `C = {c1, c2, c3, ..., cK}`  set of coin denomination (assume we have unlimited number of each)

- `N` amount of money that we need to come up with


- (Recall that greedy strategy does not always work.)

--

What is the __recurrence relation__ for this problem?

--

- relation:

  $ coins(N) = \min_{k=0}^{K}{ coins(N-c_k)} + 1$

- base case(s):

  $ coins(0) = 0 $

  $ coins(c_k) = 1 $

---
## Making change with backtracking

- We need to perform a complete search (with backtracking) to find the solution to this problem.

    - consider a function `coins` that given the amount of money and a set of
    denominations returns the mininum number of coins that one could use to make the change
    - calling `coins(N)` will solve our problem

        ```
        coins( n )
            if  n < 0   return INF   // solution is not possible
            if  n == 0  return 0     // all money used, we found a solution

            best = INF
            for all c in C
                best = min ( best ,  coins(n-c) + 1)

            return best
        ```

    - this function may make a lot of repeated calls with the same parameter


---


## Making change with DP (top-down)

- in dynamic programming we will save the results of each of the recursive calls in a table
to avoid making repeated computation
    ```
    answer = a 1D array of (N+1) elements initialized to -1

    coins( n )
        if  n < 0   return INF   // solution is not possible
        if  n == 0              // all money used, we found a solution
            answer[0] = 0
            return 0

        if answer[n] >= 0  return answer[n]

        //otherwise, compute it ...
        best = INF
        for all c in C
            best = min ( best ,  coins(n-c) + 1)

        //... and store it in the answer table
        answer[n] = best

        return best
    ```

- this guarantees that the function is called recursively at most N times (each
call fills in one of the values in the `answer` array)




---
class:challenge

## Making change with DP (bottom-up)

- we can compute the same using an iterative approach
that constructs the solution from the bottom (bottom-up approach)

- what will the algorith for this look like?

.hidden[
    ```
    answer = a 1D array of (N+1) elements
    answer[0] = 0

    for n in 1 .. N
        answer[n] = INF
        for all c in C
            if n-c >= 0
                answer[n] = min ( answer[n] ,  answer[n-c] + 1)
    ```
]

---

## Making change: which coins to use

- in the previous solutions we only determined how many coins we can use,
what if we need to know which ones to use as well?

- this means that we need to keep track of the information about
the denominations of coins that went into the optimal solution

--

    ```
    answer = a 1D array of (N+1) elements
    answer[0] = 0

    first_coin = a 1D array of (N+1) elements, it indicates for each element
                 the first coin used in the solution for that amount of money
    first_coint[0] = -1

    for n in 1 .. N
        answer[n] = INF
        for all c in C
            if n-c >= 0  AND  answer[n-c]+1 < answer[n]
                answer[n] = answer[n-c] + 1
                first_coin[n] = c
    ```
--

- and then based on the `first_coin` array we can calculate an optimal solution

    ```
    while n > 0
        print first_coin[n]
        n = n - first_coin[n]   //decrement the amount of money by the used coin
    ```

---

template: challenge

## Making change: in how many ways

- another version of this problem is not to minimize the number of coins,
but rather calculate the total number of possible ways in which we can make the requested amount

- what is the recurrence relation  in this case?

--

.hidden[

  - relation:
    $ coins(N) = \sum_{k=0}^{K}{ coins(N-c_k)} + 1$
]
.hidden[
  - base case(s):
    $ coins(0) = 0 $

]

--

- recall that the original solution picked the smallest value returned by the recursive calls,
in this new case, we actually want to calculate the sum of all the possibilities

.hidden[
    ```
    answer = a 1D array of (N+1) elements
    answer[0] = 0

    for n in 1 .. N
        answer[n] = 0
        for all c in C
            if x-c >= 0
                answer[n] = answer[n] +  answer[n-c] + 1
    ```
]

## Challenge: Best Path in a Grid

.hidden[

__Solution__

- assume that rows and columns are numbered using indexes `1..n`,
so the value of the upper left corner is `value[1][1]` and the
value of the lower right corner is `value[n][n]`

- we have the following recurrence relationship

  $$sum(x,y) = max( sum(x-1, y), sum(x,y-1) ) + value[x][y] $$
  $$sum(x,y) = 0 \text{ when } x=0 \text{ or } y=0$$

- we store the `sum[x][y]` as a two dimensional matrix equal in size to the given grid

## Wedding Shopping

## Challenge: Wedding Shopping


Given different options for each garment (e.g. 3 shirt models, 2 belt models,
4 shoe models, . . . ) and a certain limited budget,
our task is to buy one model of each garment.

We cannot spend more money than
the given budget, but we want to spend the maximum possible amount.

The __input__ consists of two integers 1 ≤ M ≤ 200 and 1 ≤ C ≤ 20, where M is the budget
and C is the number of garments that you have to buy, followed by some information about
the C garments.
For the garment g ∈ [0..C-1], we will receive an integer 1 ≤ K ≤ 20
which indicates the number of different models there are for that garment g, followed by K
integers indicating the price of each model ∈ [1..K] of that garment g.

The __output__ is one integer that indicates the maximum amount of money we can spend
purchasing one of each garment without exceeding the budget. If there is no solution due to
the small budget given to us, then simply print “no solution”.
