## Graphs: terminology and definitions

- graphs consist of _nodes_ / _vertices_ and _edges_

--
- a _path_ leads from one node to another through the edges in the graph; the
_length of a path_ is the number of edges in it; a _cycle_ is a path in which the
first and last nodes are the same

--
- a graph is _connected_ if there exists a path between every pair of nodes; connected
parts of a graph are called its _connected components_

--
- a _tree_ is a connected graph with no cycles

--
- a _directed graph_ contains edges that can be traversed in one direction

--
- a _weighted graph_ contains edges that have _weights_ assigned to them

--
- two nodes are _adjacent_ (or are _neighbors_) if there is an edge between them

--
- the _degree_ of a node is the number of nodes that are adjacent to it; the sum
of all degrees in a graph is always equal to $2m$ where $m$ is the number of edges
in the graph

--
- in a _regular_ graph the degree of each node is the same, $d$

--
- in a _complete_ graph the degree of each node is $n-1$ where $n$ is the number of nodes

--
- in a directed graph the _in-degree_ of a node is the number of edges that end at
that node and the _out-degree_ is the number of edges that start at that node

--
- a graph is _bipartite_ if is possible to color its nodes using two colors
in such a way that no adjacent nodes have the same color



---
## Graph Representations

__Adjacency List__
- each node is assigned an _adjacency list_ of nodes that are adjacent to it
- the adjacency list can be stored as a linked list or array

--

__Adjacency Matrix__
- it's a matrix indicating the edges of the graph
- the adjacency matrix can be stored as a 2D array in which `adj[a][b]` indicates
if there is an edge between nodes `a` and `b`
  - for undirected graphs, `adj[a][b]=adj[b][a]`
  - for unweighted graphs, the matrix can store binary information
  - for weighted graphs, the matrix values indicate the weight of the edge
- drawback: uses $n^2$ elements and most of them are zero

--

__Edge List__
- a list that contains all edges in the graph in some order
- convenient if an algorithm needs to traverse all the edges and it is not
necessary to find edges that start/end in a particular node
- elements in the list a pairs of nodes indicating the end-points for each edge


---
## Graph Representations

__Implicit Graph__
- graphs that are not stored using graphs data structures (like the ones in the previous slide)
- used when the edge connectivity can be determined easily and/or if they can be determined
using some rules
- examples
  - A 2D grid represents a labirinth. The cells with passable corridors are marked with
    '.'. The cells with solid walls are marked with '#'. Each of those cells is an _implicit_ node
    in a graph. There is an _implicit_ edge between two nodes if the the two cells are connected
    along one of the four sides and they are both marked with a '.'.
  - A graph contains N nodes labeled 0..N. There is an edge between two nodes if a sum
    of their labels is even.


---

## Traversing a Graph

Task: given a starting node in a graph, visit all nodes that can be reached from that node.

--

- depth first search traversal (DFS)

- breadth first search traversal (BFS)

---
## Depth First Search Traversal

.right-column2-small[
<img src="img/graph1.png" width=200px />
]

- follows a single path through the graph as long as there are un-visited nodes
- after it cannot find any more nodes to visit, it _returns_ to previous nodes and
follows unexplored paths from them
- needs to keep track of visited nodes

<p>

--

- what order will the DFS traversal visit the nodes in the graph on the right when we start DFS at 1?

--

  - 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 3 -> 6
  - 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
  - 1 -> 6 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 3
  - 1 -> 6 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5

--

- algorithm using the adjacency list of a graph, O(n+m)

  ```
  visited[N] - boolean array with all values set initially to false

  dfs ( start )
      if visited[start] return   //already processed this node

      visited[start] = true      //mark node as visited

      for n in adj[start]
          dfs( n )

  ```

---
## Breadth First Search Traversal

.right-column2-small[
<img src="img/graph1.png" width=200px />
]

- visits the nodes in order of their distance from a starting node
(distance = path length between nodes)
  - visit all nodes whose distance from the start node is 1
  - visit all nodes whose distance from the start node is 2
  - ...

<p>

--

- what order will the BFS traversal visit the nodes in the graph on the right when we start BFS at 1?

--

  - 1 -- 2,6 -- 3,5,4
  (where a,b indicates that the order in which a and b are visited does not matter )
--

- algorithm using the adjacency list of a graph, O(n+m)

  ```
  visited[N] - boolean array with all values set initially to false
  queue      - to store nodes to be visited

  bfs ( start )
      visited [ start ] = true
      queue.push( start )

      while queue is not empty
          node = queue.pop()
          for n in adj( node )
              if ! visited[n]
                  visited [n] = true
                  queue.push( n )

  ```

## Bottleneck
<!-- UVA 11902-->

.small[
From Wikipedia article [_Dominator (graph theory)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominator_%28graph_theory%29)
]


.right-column2-small[<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Dominator_control_flow_graph.svg/200px-Dominator_control_flow_graph.svg.png"
width=200px />]

In computer science, in control flow graphs, a node `d` _dominates_ a node `n` if
every path from the entry node to `n` must go through `d`. Notationally, this is
written as `d dom n`. By definition, every node dominates itself.

.right-column2-small[
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Dominator_tree.svg/1920px-Dominator_tree.svg.png"
width=200px />
]

In the graphs on the right, if a starting vertex is 1, then the node with label 2 is a
dominator for all the nodes except 1.


In a network, if a node is a dominator for many other nodes it is potentially
a problem leading to bottlenecks and points of failure.



<br><br>


__Task__: Given a directed graph and a starting node, find the dominators of every vertex/node.

## Bottleneck

.smaller[

__Input__:

Each graph starts with an integer N (0 < N < 100) that represents the number of
nodes in the graph. The next N lines contain N integers each. If the j-th (0 based)
integer of i-th (0 based) line is ‘1’, it means that there is an edge from node i to node j and
similarly a ‘0’ means there is no edge.

The starting node is always Oth node.

__Ouput__:

Otput 2N + 1 lines that summarizes the dominator
relationship between every pair of nodes. If node A dominates node B, output ‘Y’ in cell (A, B),
otherwise output ‘N’. Cell (A, B) means cell at A-th row and B-th column. Surround the output with
‘|’, ‘+’ and ‘-’ to make it more legible. Look at the samples for exact format.

Input:
```

## Bottleneck

__Solution idea__

- run a graph traversal (BFS or DFS) to determine which nodes are reachable from the given start node
- for each node A in the graph
  - remove that node from the original graph
  - run a graph traversal (BFS or DFS)
  - nodes that were reachable in the original graph, but are not reachable now are dominated by node A

## Follow the Path
<!--UVA 10116-->

You are programming a new robot called Frank to navigate the path through a grid. Frank should be able to  adjust the
direction it is moving in based on the current position rather than being pre-programmed.
This particular robot needs to navigate through a 2D grid. At each grid location Frank receives the instructions
for its next move. The possible moves are:
.small[
- N - move North (or up)
- S - move South (or down)
- E - move East (or right)
- W - move West (or left)
]

Your task now is to calculate what path Frank will take and verify that it actually took that path (otherwise
you have a bug in the code that directs Frank through the grid).

--

__Example 1:__
.left-column2-small[

```
              F
  N  E  E  S<-W  E
           v
<-W<-W  W  E->S  S
     ^        v
  S  N<-W<-W<-W  W

```
]
.right-column2-large[
If Frank enters this grid at the grid location just below of the position of F,
it will move west, then south, then east, then south, then west three times, then
north and west two more times and finally it will exit the grid.
]

---

template: frank

__Example 2:__
.left-column2-small[
```
  F
  S  E  S<-W  E
  v     v  ^
  E->E->S  N<-W
        v     ^
  N  W  E->E->N

  N  W  S  W  N

```
]
.right-column2-large[
If Frank enters this grid at the grid location just below of the position of F,
it will move south, then east twice, and then it will enter a loop consisting of
8 moves. Frank will never leave this grid.
]

## Follow the Path

.smaller[
__Input__

On the first line are three integers separated by blanks: the number of rows in the grid,
the number of columns in the grid, and the number of the column in which the
robot enters from the north.
The possible entry columns are numbered starting with one at the left.

Then come the rows of the direction
instructions. Each grid will have at least one and at most 10 rows and columns of instructions. The
lines of instructions contain only the characters N, S, E, or W with no blanks.

__Output__

There should be one line of output. Either the robot follows a certain number of
instructions and exits the grid on any one the four sides or else the robot follows
the instructions on a certain number of locations once, and then the instructions
on some number of locations repeatedly.
The sample input below corresponds to the two grids above and illustrates the two
forms of output.
The word “step” is always immediately followed by “(s)” whether or not the number
before it is 1.
]

.left-column2[
__Example 1__:

Input:
```
3 6 5
NEESWE
WWWESS
SNWWWW
```

Output:
```
10 step(s) to exit
```
]
.right-column2[
__Example 2__:

Input:
```
4 5 1
SESWE
EESNW
NWEEN
EWSEN
```

Output:
```
3 step(s) before a loop of 8 step(s)
```

## Follow the Path

__Solution idea__

- follow the path according to the directions starting at the start point
- for each visited location, increment the number of steps taken
- for each visited location, mark it as visited
- if the directions end outside of the grid, report the number of steps taken
- if the path leads to already visited location, report that there is a loop

--

??? how should we keep track of the length of the loop?

--

two options:

--
  - associate a number of steps taken so far with each location, then the length of the loop
    can be computed as soon as a visited location is reached

--
  - once loop is discovered, start a loop counter and follow the path once again until
  the loop is completed counting the steps along the way

## Word Transformations
<!-- UVA 429 -->

Given a dictionary of words, find the number of steps it takes to transform one
word into another.
- a single step consists of changing one letter in the current word
- all "words" along the way have to be dictionary words

--

.left-column2[
__Example 1:__

dictionary: bar, bat, cab, car, cat, hat

how many steps: cat --> bar

answer: 2 steps, cat --> car --> bar
]

--

.right-column2[
__Example 2:__

dictionary: dip
lip, mad, map, maple, may, pad, pip, pod, pop, sap, sip, slice, slick, spice, stick, stock

how many steps: spice --> stock

answer: 4 steps, spice --> slice --> slick --> stick --> stock

]

--

.left-column2[
__Example 3:__

dictionary: dip
lip, mad, map, maple, may, pad, pip, pod, pop, sap, sip, slice, slick, spice, stick, stock

how many steps: may --> pod

answer: 3 steps, may --> mad --> pad --> pod

]

class: challenge

## Word Transformations
### Solution Idea 1

- Build a graph of all the dictionary words: there is an edge between two
words if they differ exactly by one letter.

--

  (This is $O(n^2)$ since we need to compare each pair of nodes.)
--

- Run BFS from the starting word, until the final word is encountered.


--

__Issues:__

This works when $n$ is small and using $O(n^2)$ algorithm is possible. But what if we are working
with more _realistic_ dictionary, say 100,000 words?


---

class: challenge

## Word Transformations
### Solution Idea 2

- Run BFS on an implicit graph:

  - given a word W, change every letter of W to every other letter of the alphabet ($25L$ when $L$ is the length of the word)

  - check if the resulting word is in the dictionary (for each check, it is $O(\log n)$ when $n$ is the size of the dictionary)

  - if it is, it is one of the adjacent nodes of W  (store it in a queue for later exploration)
