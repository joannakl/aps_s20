## Bit operations



```
0101    0101    0101
0011    0011    0011     0101
   &       |       ^        ~
----    ----    ----     ----
0001    0111    0110     1010

```

--

left shift <<

```
00101
  <<2
10100
```
--

right shift >>

.small[in C/C++, the right shift operator is performing logical or arithmetic
shift depending on the context; in Java, there are two right shift operators: `>>`
performs the arithmetic shift, `>>>` performs the logical shift]

```
001010
   >>2
000010
```

--

- shifting is equivalent to multiplying by powers of two (but faster)
- WARNING: avoid shifting out of the type range



---
## Bit-mask

A __bit mask__ of the form `1 << k` has one bit on (i.e., equal to 1)
in the `k`<sup>th</sup> position and all other bits off (i.e., equal to 0).

- to determine if a bit at the `k`<sup>th</sup> position in a particular value
is on or off, we can use this bit mask and the bitwise `and` operator: `x & (1 << k)`

  example:

  ```
  for (int k = 31; k >=0; k--) {
      if (x & (1 << k) )
        cout << "1";
      else
        cout << "0";
  }
  ```
  What does this code do?

--

  It prints the binary represetnation of `x` (assuming that `x` is a 32-bit variable).

---
## Bit-mask continued

Modifying bits within a value:

- set the `k`<sup>th</sup> bit to be on (regardless of what it was before):
  ???

- set the `k`<sup>th</sup> bit to be off (regardless of what it was before):
  ???

- set the `k`<sup>th</sup> bit to be on if it is currently off, and to be off if it is
currently on (just flip that bit to the opposite): ???


- invert all bits after the last (least significant) one bit: ???

- set the last (least significant) one bit in x to 0: ???

- test if x is a power of two: ???




---
## Bit-mask continued

Modifying bits within a value:

- set the `k`<sup>th</sup> bit to be on (regardless of what it was before):
  `x = x | (1 << k)`

- set the `k`<sup>th</sup> bit to be off (regardless of what it was before):
  `x = x & ~(1 << k)`

- set the `k`<sup>th</sup> bit to be on if it is currently off, and to be off if it is
currently on (just flip that bit to the opposite): `x = x ^ (1 << k)`


- invert all bits after  the last (least significant) one bit: `x = x | (x-1)`

- set the last (least significant) one bit in x to 0: `x = x & (x - 1)`

- test if x is a power of two: `x & (x - 1) == 0`

--
<br><br>

`(1 << k)`  is a 32-bit mask (1 is an `int`)

to use a 64-bit bit mask: use (`1L << k`)

--
.small[
The last three operations depend on understanding of the relationship between `x` and `x-1` in binary.
Here are some examples:

|decimal | binary ||decimal | binary ||decimal | binary |
|---|---||---|---||---|---|
|45 | 0010 1101 || 32 | 0010 0000 || 36 | 0010 0100 |
|44 | 0010 1100 || 31 | 0001 1111 || 35 | 0010 0011 |

(when we compare `x` to `x-1` all the bits starting at the least significant `1` bit are flipped)

## Useful library functions, C/C++


- `__builtin_clz(x)`: the number of zeros at the beginning of the bit representation

- `__builtin_ctz(x)`: the number of zeros at the end of the bit representation

- `__builtin_popcount(x)`: the number of ones in the bit representation

- `__builtin_parity(x)`: the parity (even or odd) of the number of ones in the
bit representation

--

example

```
int x = 5328; // 00000000000000000001010011010000
cout <<  __builtin_clz(x) << "\n"; // 19
cout <<  __builtin_ctz(x) << "\n"; // 4
cout <<  __builtin_popcount(x) << "\n"; // 5
cout <<  __builtin_parity(x) << "\n"; // 1

```

--

Add `l`  suffix to the above functions to use the `long` versions instead of `int`.


---

## Useful library functions, Java

 in `Integer` class :

- `int 	bitCount(int i)`<br>
Returns the number of one-bits in the two's complement binary representation of the specified int value.

- `int 	highestOneBit(int i)`<br>
Returns an int value with at most a single one-bit, in the position of the highest-order ("leftmost") one-bit in the specified int value.

- `int 	lowestOneBit(int i)`<br>
Returns an int value with at most a single one-bit, in the position of the lowest-order ("rightmost") one-bit in the specified int value.

- `int 	numberOfLeadingZeros(int i)`<br>
Returns the number of zero bits preceding the highest-order ("leftmost") one-bit in the two's complement binary representation of the specified int value.

## Exercises

- Write a code fragment that sets (turns on) every  bit in an even position in
 an integer mask. (Can you define such a mask in one _step_?)

- Compute the _distance_ between two bitmasks, i.e., how many positions in
the two values are different? (this is known as
the [hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance))

## Exercises

- Write a code fragment that sets (turns on) every  bit in an even position in
 an integer mask.

    ```C++
    x = 0;
    for (int i=0; i < 31; i=i+2) {
      x = x | (1 << i);
    }
    ```
  or
    ```C
    x = 0x55555555;
    ```


- Compute the _distance_ between two bitmasks, i.e., how many positions in
the two values are different? (this is known as hamming distance)

    ```Java
    Integer.bitCount ( x ^ y )
    ```

## Sets

## Representing sets

Any subset of a set
$${0, 1, 2, 3, ..., n-1 }$$
can be represented by an `n`-bit integer. The bits of a number indicate
if the element is present in the set or not.

__Example__

`0000000000000000000100100001011`

represents the subset {0, 1, 3, 8, 11}

To create such a subset representation use code as follows:

```C++
int x = 0;
x |= (1 << 0);
x |= (1 << 1);
x |= (1 << 3);
x |= (1 << 8);
x |= (1 << 11);
```
<!--
and to print the size of such a subset, use

```C++
cout << __builtin_popcount(x) <<"\n";
```
-->
---


## Set operations

How can the following operations be performed on the sets
represented by integers:

- set intersection $A\cap B$ (what do the two sets have in common)
- set union $A\cup B$ (all elements in either one, or both sets)
- set difference $A \setminus B$ (all elements in A that are not in B)

--

Assume that two integers `a` and `b` represent two sets (max number of elements in each
set is 32).

- `a & b` is the intersection
- `a | b` is the union
- `a & (~b)` is the difference

---
template: challenge

## Exercises

- Create two sets $a={1, 3, 8, 11, 23, 27 }$ and $b={1, 2, 4, 11, 15, 27}$. Compute their
union, intersection and difference. For each print the content of the set and its size.
- List all possible subsets of a set ${0,1,2,...,31}$.
- List all possible subsets of a set ${0,1,2,...,31}$ that have exactly 7 elements.

## Example Application:
## Prime Numbers

template: challenge

## Primality Test

__Task__: given a number N determine if it is prime or not

--



Very naive algorithm: $O(N)$ (check if any of the numbers from 1 to N is a divisor)

Better algorithm: $O(\sqrt(N))$ (check if any of the numbers from 1 to $\sqrt(N)$ is a divisor)

Even better algorithm: $O(\sqrt(N))$ (check if any of the numbers from 1 to $\sqrt(N)$
is a divisor, but only test the odd values  after testing 2)

--
<br><br>

Idea:

- in the above _even better algorithm_ we skipped all the multiple of two after verifying if the number
was divisible by 2
--

- what if we skipped all multiples of three after verifying if the number was divisible by 3

--
- how about skipping all multiples of 5?
--

- 7?

__Sieve of Eratosthenes__

- $O(N \log\log N)$


- Algorithm:
  - set all values in the range to _probably prime_
  - set 0 and 1 to be ~~not prime~~
  - for p in 2:N
      - if p is _probably prime_
          - set p to __definitely prime__
          - set all multiples of p (except for p itself) to ~~not prime~~

## Sieve of Eratosthenes


- Example: N = 20

  - ~~0~~ ~~1~~ _2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20_

--

  - ~~0~~ ~~1~~ __2__ _3_ ~~4~~ _5_ ~~6~~ _7_ ~~8~~ _9_ ~~10~~ _11_ ~~12~~ _13_ ~~14~~ _15_ ~~16~~ _17_ ~~18~~ _19_ ~~20~~

--

  - ~~0~~ ~~1~~ __2__ __3__ ~~4~~ _5_ ~~6~~ _7_ ~~8~~ ~~9~~ ~~10~~ _11_ ~~12~~ _13_ ~~14~~ ~~15~~ ~~16~~ _17_ ~~18~~ _19_ ~~20~~

--

  - ~~0~~ ~~1~~ __2__ __3__ ~~4~~ __5__ ~~6~~ _7_ ~~8~~ ~~9~~ ~~10~~ _11_ ~~12~~ _13_ ~~14~~ ~~15~~ ~~16~~ _17_ ~~18~~ _19_ ~~20~~

--

  - ~~0~~ ~~1~~ __2__ __3__ ~~4~~ __5__ ~~6~~ __7__ ~~8~~ ~~9~~ ~~10~~ _11_ ~~12~~ _13_ ~~14~~ ~~15~~ ~~16~~ _17_ ~~18~~ _19_ ~~20~~

--

  - ~~0~~ ~~1~~ __2__ __3__ ~~4~~ __5__ ~~6~~ __7__ ~~8~~ ~~9~~ ~~10~~ __11__ ~~12~~ _13_ ~~14~~ ~~15~~ ~~16~~ _17_ ~~18~~ _19_ ~~20~~

--

  - past the halfway point, all the remaining probably primes are definitely prime <br>
  ~~0~~ ~~1~~ __2__ __3__ ~~4~~ __5__ ~~6~~ __7__ ~~8~~ ~~9~~ ~~10~~ __11__ ~~12~~ __13__ ~~14~~ ~~15~~ ~~16~~ __17__ ~~18~~ __19__ ~~20~~

--

- Can we stop before a half-way point?

--

  stop after reaching $\sqrt(N)$:

  - Algorithm:
      - set all values in the range to _probably prime_
      - set 0 and 1 to be ~~not prime~~
      - for p in 2: $\sqrt(N)$
          - if p is _probably prime_
              - set p to __definitely prime__
              - set all multiples of p up to N (except for p itself) to ~~not prime~~
