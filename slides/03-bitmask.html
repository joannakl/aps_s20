# Questions

- homework 2 questions?

- comments about homework 1?

- any other questions?

--

-----

- please, do not remove posts from Piazza

- starting in hwk 3, you will not be able to see _your output_ vs _expected output_ for wrong answers and presentation errors

- use tools that help you figure out where your program might be having issues, ex. `valgrind`

- read warnings produced by your compiler (and ask the compiler for as many warnings as possible)

- shifting is equivalent to multiplying by powers of two (but faster)
- WARNING: avoid shifting out of the type range

.footnote[
<sup>*</sup> in C/C++, the right shift operator is performing logical or arithmetic
shift depending on the context; in Java, there are two right shift operators: `>>`
performs the arithmetic shift, `>>>` performs the logical shift

# Bit-mask

A __bit mask__ of the form `1 << k` has one bit on (i.e., equal to 1)
in the `k`<sup>th</sup> position and all other bits off (i.e., equal to 0).

- to determine if a bit at the `k`<sup>th</sup> position in a particular value
is on or off, we can use this bit mask and the bitwise and operator: `x & (1 << k)`

  example:

  ```
  for (int k = 31; k >=0; k--) {
      if (x & (1 << k) )
        cout << "1";
      else
        cout << "0";
  }
  ```
  What does this code do?

--

  It prints the binary represetnation of `x` (assuming that `x` is a 32-bit variable).

---
# Bit-mask continued

Modifying bits within a value:

- set the `k`<sup>th</sup> bit to be on (regardless of what it was before):
  ???

- set the `k`<sup>th</sup> bit to be off (regardless of what it was before):
  ???

- set the `k`<sup>th</sup> bit to be on if it is currently off, and to be off if it is
currently on (just flip that bit to the opposite): ???


- invert all bits after the last (least significant) one bit: ???

- set the last (least significant) one bit in x to 0: ???

- test if x is a power of two: ???




---
# Bit-mask continued

Modifying bits within a value:

- set the `k`<sup>th</sup> bit to be on (regardless of what it was before):
  `x = x| (1 << k)`

- set the `k`<sup>th</sup> bit to be off (regardless of what it was before):
  `x = x & (1 << k)`

- set the `k`<sup>th</sup> bit to be on if it is currently off, and to be off if it is
currently on (just flip that bit to the opposite): `x = x ^ (1 << k)`


- invert all bits after  the last (least significant) one bit: `x = x | (x-1)`

- set the last (least significant) one bit in x to 0: `x & (x - 1)`

- test if x is a power of two: `x & (x - 1) == 0`

--
<br><br>

`(1 << k)`  is a 32-bit mask (1 is an `int`)

to use a 64-bit bit mask: use (`1L << k`)

---

# Useful library functions, C/C++


- `__builtin_clz(x)`: the number of zeros at the beginning of the bit representation

- `__builtin_ctz(x)`: the number of zeros at the end of the bit representation

- `__builtin_popcount(x)`: the number of ones in the bit representation

- `__builtin_parity(x)`: the parity (even or odd) of the number of ones in the
bit representation

--

example

```
int x = 5328; // 00000000000000000001010011010000
cout <<  __builtin_clz(x) << "\n"; // 19
cout <<  __builtin_ctz(x) << "\n"; // 4
cout <<  __builtin_popcount(x) << "\n"; // 5
cout <<  __builtin_parity(x) << "\n"; // 1

```

--

Add `l`  suffix to the above functions to use the `long` versions instead of `int`.

# Useful library functions, Java

 in `Integer` class :

- `int 	bitCount(int i)`<br>
Returns the number of one-bits in the two's complement binary representation of the specified int value.

- `int 	highestOneBit(int i)`<br>
Returns an int value with at most a single one-bit, in the position of the highest-order ("leftmost") one-bit in the specified int value.

- `int 	lowestOneBit(int i)`<br>
Returns an int value with at most a single one-bit, in the position of the lowest-order ("rightmost") one-bit in the specified int value.

- `int 	numberOfLeadingZeros(int i)`<br>
Returns the number of zero bits preceding the highest-order ("leftmost") one-bit in the two's complement binary representation of the specified int value.

# Exercises

- Write a code fragment that sets (turns on) every  bit in an even position in
 an integer mask. (Can you define such a mask in one _step_?)

- Compute the _distance_ between two bitmasks, i.e., how many positions in
the two values are different? (this is known as
the [hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance))

# Sets

# Representing sets

Any subset of a set
$${0, 1, 2, 3, ..., n-1 }$$
can be represented by an `n`-bit integer. The bits of a number indicate
if the element is present in the set or not.

__Example__

`0000000000000000000100100001011`

represents the subset {0, 1, 3, 8, 11}

To create such a subset representation use code as follows:

```C++
int x = 0;
x |= (1 << 0);
x |= (1 << 1);
x |= (1 << 3);
x |= (1 << 8);
x |= (1 << 11);
```
<!--
and to print the size of such a subset, use

```C++
cout << __builtin_popcount(x) <<"\n";
```
-->

# Set operations

How can the following operations be performed on the sets
represented by integers:

- set intersection $A\cap B$ (what do the two sets have in common)
- set union $A\cup B$ (all elements in either one, or both sets)
- set difference $A \setminus B$ (all elements in A that are not in B)

--

Assume that two integers `a` and `b` represent two sets (max number of elements in each
set is 32).

- `a & b` is the intersection
- `a | b` is the union
- `a & (~b)` is the difference

---

# Exercises

- Create two sets $a={1, 3, 8, 11, 23, 27 }$ and $b={1, 2, 4, 11, 15, 27}$. Compute their
union, intersection and difference. For each print the content of the set and its size.
- List all possible subsets of a set ${0,1,2,...,31}$.
- List all possible subsets of a set ${0,1,2,...,31}$ that have exactly 7 elements.
