## Greedy


- solving problems by making locally (at each step) optimal choices with
the hope of obtaining optimal solution overall

- when does it work
    - problem has optimal sub-structure: optimal solution for the problem
      contains optimal solutions for sub-problems
    - problem has a greedy property: optimal choices made at the moment
      lead to otpimal overall solution (no need to go back and explore
      an alternative)

- examples

## Challenge: Making Change

__Task__

Given an amount V (in cents) and a list of denominations of n coins find
the way to make the change with the minimum number of coins.
Assume that you have unlimited supply of each coin (for each given denomination).

---
class:challenge

## Challenge: Making Change

__Example__

- n = 4
- denominations = {25, 10, 5, 1} cents
- desired amount V = 47 cents

solution:
- start with the largest denomination and use as many coins as possible<br>
  47 - 25 = 22
- use the next highest denomination <br>
  22 - 10 = 12 <br>
  12 - 10 = 2 <br>
- the remaining amount is too small for the denomination of 5, so skip it
- use the last denomination <br>
  2 - 1 = 1 <br>
  2 - 1 = 0 <br>

so we need 5 coins: 25, 10, 10, 1, 1

## Challenge: Making Change

This problem posseses both characteristics that make the greedy solution
applicable here:

- the solutions to its subproblems are optimal, for example
    - for 22 cents, the otpimal solution would be 4 coins: {10, 10, 1, 1}
    - for 12 cents, the optimal solution would be 3 coins: {10, 1, 1}

- the solution has a greedy property: we use the largest possible
coin first, if we used a smaller one instead, we would have to replace that
coin with more than one coin in the alternative solution.

_Note_<br>

This approach does not work for all denominations. It does work for
American coins of {25, 10, 5, 1} cents.

## Computing Center Load Balancing

You are an operator of a super computing center and in control of M nodes.
One day, a research institute from Light Kingdom submitted N computational
tasks. Given the computational power needed for each task, you are to distribute the tasks among
the available nodes. Restriction: every node can process up to two tasks.
You also want to distribute the
workload as evenly as possible, i.e. minimize the following imbalance value

$$Imbalance = \sum_{i=0}^{M-1}{|Avg-Load_i|} $$

where $Avg$ is average load per node and $Load_i$ is the load of the
i-th node.

__Input__:
The first line of the input contains two integers M (1 <= M <= 5) and N (1 <= N
<= 2M), indicating the number of nodes you control and the number of tasks,
respectively.
The second line contains N integers, each of which represents the computational
power required for a task. Numbers on this line are between 1 and 1000.

__Output__:
Print one line `IMBALANCE = I` where `I` is the minimum imbalance value rounded
to 5 decimal places.

```
Input:
2 3
6 3 8

Output:
IMBALANCE = 1.00000
```

__Example 2__

```
Input:
3 5
51 19 27 14 33

Output:
IMBALANCE = 6.00000
```

__Example 3__

```
Input:
5 9
1 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19

Output:
IMBALANCE = 11.60000
```

__Observation 1__: If there is an empty computing node in the final solution, than it is always
beneficial (in the sense that the new solution is not worse than the original) to move
one task from a computing node with two tasks to the empty one. Otherwise, the empty
computing node contributes more to the imbalance than the alternative assignment.

__Observation 2__: If N > M, then N-M tasks must be scheduled on computing nodes that
already contain other tasks.

Station Balance

__Solution__

- If S <= C, then place each specimen in its own chamber. Some chambers might be empty.

- If S > C, then
    - create 2C - S dummy specimens with weight zero
    - sort 2C specimens (including the dummy ones)
    - pair the specimens from the beginning and end of the sorted list (i.e., smallest
    with largest, second smallest with second largest, ... until all are used) and
    place each pair in a chamber


.small[

__Example__

C = 3, S = 4, M = {5, 1, 2, 7}

The average weight A = (5+1+2+7)/3 = 5

M with dummy specimens = { 5, 1, 2, 7, 0, 0}

sorted M with dummy specimens = {0, 0, 1, 2, 5, 7}

Optimal specimens to chamber assignment:

C1 = 7 <br>
C2 = 5 <br>
C3 = 1, 2 <br>

Imbalance = | 7 - 5| + |5 - 5| + | 3 - 5| = 4
