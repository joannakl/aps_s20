## College Entry Exams During a Pandemic

- You are in charge of a large testing center administering college entry exams
for a large number of students distributed all around the world.

--

- It is spring of 2020. Covid-19 disrupts everything. The decision was made to cancel
all in-person exams.

--

- Your company needs to figure out how to provide an equivalent that can be administered
to students distributed in different time zones, with very different access to technology
and unknown living conditions.

--

- What do you do?

# _When Algorithms Give Real Students Imaginary Grades_

In-person final exams were canceled for thousands of students this spring, so computers stepped in — to disastrous effect. <br>

## _When Algorithms Give Real Students Imaginary Grades_



__Isabel Castañeda__ is a native Spanish speaker. Her family comes from Mexico. She attends Westminster High in Colorado.
She got a 5 out of 5 on her Advanced Placement Spanish exam (2019), after two straight years of A+ grades in Spanish class.

In spring of 2020 she took the International Baccalaureate Spanish exam  ... __and failed.__

__Anahita Nagpal__, who lives in Göttingen, Germany, had been offered a pre-med place and scholarship at NYU.
Her acceptance was dependent on her results in the International Baccalaureate diploma,
a two-year high school program recognized by colleges and taken by more than 170,000 students
this year, most in the US. __But she scored more poorly than expected.__

## _When Algorithms Give Real Students ..._


"The International Baccalaureate - a global program that awards a prestigious diploma to students
in addition to the one they receive from their high schools - canceled its usual in-person final exams
because of the pandemic. Instead, it used an algorithm to “predict” students’ grades, based on an
array of student information, including teacher-estimated grades and past performance by students
in each school."

<br>__In normal years:__
- coursework counts for some 20-30% of the overall final grade
- the exam accounts for the remainder.

(Prior to the exam, teachers provide “predicted” grades, which allow universities to offer places
conditional on the candidates’ final grades meeting the predictions.)

- predictions that teachers made about how students would perform on the exam
- coursework
- "school context", i.e., historical data on students' performance from the given school

## Biased Judges

- Judges are humans and come with their own biased opinions.

--

- During sentencing it is often up to the judge to decide the severity of the
penalty based on the sentence ranges dictated by the state and federal laws.

--

- It has been observed that the judges in your area seem to be giving more
severe penalties to people with certain socio-economic backgrounds.

--

- As a consultant for your judicial district, you are asked for advice on how this
problem could avoided.

# _When an Algorithm Helps Send You to Prison_

Giving a computer program responsibility over sentences doesn’t eliminate bias.

Oct. 26, 2017, By Ellora Thadaney Israni

## _When an Algorithm Helps Send You to Prison_

.small[from NYT, https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/opinion/algorithm-compas-sentencing-bias.html?smid=em-share]

In 2013, police officers in Wisconsin arrested a man driving a car that had
been used in a recent shooting. The man, Eric Loomis, pleaded guilty to attempting
to flee an officer, and no contest to operating a vehicle without the owner’s
consent. Neither of his crimes mandates prison time.

--

At Mr. Loomis’s sentencing, the judge cited, among other factors, Mr. Loomis’s
high risk of recidivism as predicted by a computer program called COMPAS, a risk
assessment algorithm used by the state of Wisconsin. The judge denied probation
and prescribed an 11-year sentence: six years in prison, plus five years of
extended supervision.

### COMPAS Software

.small[from Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMPAS_(software)]

__Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS)__ is
a case management and decision support tool developed and owned by Northpointe
(now Equivant) used by U.S. courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist.

COMPAS has been used by the U.S. states of New York, Wisconsin, California,
Florida's Broward County, and other jurisdictions.

<br><br>
__The internal algorithms that perform decision making and risk assessment in COMPAS were never made public.__

<br>Computers may be intelligent, but they are not wise. Everything they know, we
taught them, and we taught them our biases. They are not going to un-learn them
without transparency and corrective action by humans.

# Zillow, facing big losses, quits flipping houses and will lay off a quarter of its staff.
November 2, 2021, by Stephen Gandel,

## Zillow, quits flipping houses

- Zillow is a real estate listing site.

--

- It's __zestimate__ attempts to predict the value of real estate (not only actual listings, but anything)

--

- Zillow Offers is a part of Zillow that focuses on _flipping houses_: they make instant offers for listings
that are below their zestimate, they renovate/fix-up the property and sell it for a hire price.

--

- __What can go wrong?__
--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well! Everything!

--
-----

.small[from CNN, https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/09/tech/zillow-ibuying-home-zestimate/index.html ]
<br>
- According to CNN, the company purchased 27,000 properties in this way since April 2018, but sold only
17,000 as of September 2021.

--

- As of November 2021, Zillow is cutting 25% of its workforce (~2000 employees).

--

- "The challenge we faced in Zillow Offers was the ability to accurately forecast the future
price of inventory three to six months out, in a market where there were larger and more rapid
changes in home values than ever before," Shelton said.

# Your Role


---
template: section


## What is our ethical/moral responsibility as the code/algorithm designers?

---

## Other issues to think about:


* Using code that is _out there_? Plagiarism or not?

* Hacking? Good or bad?

* Open vs. closed source code?
