## Online Contest (4 problems)

.small[
Throughout the semester we will let you know about various online contests.
You need to participate in one or more and submit passing solutions to four
different problems (in a single contest or in multiple ones).

- Codeforces
- ICPC Practice contests

__Do not use Leetcode contests.
Do not use contests that are arranged by small unknown groups. You can always check with me if a given contest
is acceptable.__

]

--

When you register for the contest
- indicate NYU as your association/university
- you can use any user name (but, you will need to make it available to us for grading purposes)

--


When you successfully solve a problem:
- make a post on Ed using "Online Contests" category
- include a link to the problem that you successfully solved (the problem statement itself)
- include a screenshot showing that your solution was accepted (this screenshot should contain your
username, date/time at which the problem was submitted and the status showing it was accepted)
- create a runnable code block with your solution so other people
can see it and test it out

If you solve more than one problem in a single contest, make multiple posts.

__These posts should be made after the contest ends and within one week of contest completion
(not on the last day of classes!).__ The problems have to be completed while the contest is open, not after
(some contest sites allow later submissions).

## Operations Count

- How fast your program runs depends on how many things it does

  _things_ == operations that the CPU performs on behalf of the program

- How many things the computer does depends on how you (the programmer) write
the code, what algorithm you chose, etc

--

So, how many operations does this program perform:
.left-column2[
```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++ ) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 10; j++ ) {
      printf("%3d\t", i*j);
    }
    printf("\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```
]

--

.right-column2[
  .huge[.center[???]]
]

---
## Counting operations is not easy (possible)

- hard to figure out what to count, some operations in the high level
programming language may be actualy multiple operations on the CPU

- some CPU operations are faster then others

- some operations require I/O and that slows them down

--

.big[we need a simplified way of deciding how fast the program runs]

# Asymptotic Analysis

---

## Asymptotic Analysis


__$O(g(n)) = f(n)$__

There exist positive constants _c_ and _$n_0$_ such that
$0 <= f(n) <= cg(n)$ for all $n >= n_0$

--

<hr>

__ $\Omega(g(n)) = f(n)$__

There exist positive constants _$c$_ and _$n_0$_ such that
$0 <= cg(n)<= f(n) $ for all $n >= n_0$

--

<hr>

__ $\Theta(g(n)) = f(n)$__

There exist positive constants _$c_1$_, _$c_2$_ and _$n_0$_ such that
$0 <= c_1g(n) <= f(n) <= c_2g(n) $ for all $n >= n_0$

---

## Asymptotic Analysis: Big O

.center[
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Big-O-notation.png" width=50%>
]

Example of Big O notation:

f(x) ∈ O(g(x)) says that there exists c > 0 (e.g., c = 1) and x0 (e.g., x0 = 5) such that f(x) ≤ cg(x) whenever x ≥ x0.

## Challenge

For each of the following functions state if it is $O(N^2)$:

- $3 N^2 + 25 N - 20000$

- $0.00001 N^3 + 5 N + 2$

- $3N!$

- $2^N$

- $\log N$

- $1$


---
## "Abuse" of Big O

People often say "The algorithm is $O(N^3)$ - this is slow".

An algorithm that performs in constant time is $O(N^3)$ so the above
does not make much sense.

But this is a common abuse of the terminology. We really mean that
the algorithm is $\Theta(N^3)$, even though we use the Big O description.




---
## From Big O to Actual Execution Time

- a typical machine executes approximately $10^9$ operations per second
 (on average, since some are slower than others)

--

- to determine how long it might take the program to execute on the largest
possible input size (this is specified as part of the constrains for the problem)
  - determine the the Big O term for the maximum N
  - divide the result by $10^9$

  (this will give you the number of seconds it should take your program
  to solve the problem - again, this is an approximation, but
  it gives us the sense of what might happen)

---
## From Big O to Actual Execution Time


__Example__: check all pairs of value in the input set

- Performance is $O(N^2)$

--

- when $N = 10$, $N^2 = 100$, time = $100 / 10^9$   => program finishes immediately

--

- when $N = 1000$, $N^2 = 1,000,000$, time = $10^6 / 10^9$  => program finishes in 0.001s (practically instantly)

--

- when $N = 10^5$, $N^2 = 10^{10}$, time = $10^{10} / 10^9$  => program finishes in 10s
(too long for most of the kinds of problems that we will be looking at)

## What's the performance of ...

```C++
int ans = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++ ) {
  for (int j = 0; j < n; j++ ) {
    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++ ) {
      ans += i*j + j*k + k*i;
    }
  }
}
```

.big[$O(N^3)$]

```C++
int ans = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++ ) {
  for (int j = i+1; j < n; j++ ) {
    for (int k = j+1; k < n; k++ ) {
      ans += i*j + j*k + k*i;
    }
  }
}
```

## Challenge

Write a function that checks if a string Y is a substring of another
string X. The function should return `true` or `false`.

Ex.

X = 'abcdaaaabbbbcddd'

- Y = 'ab'  => function returns `true`
- Y = 'abab'  => function returns `false`


---
template: challenge

## What's the performance of ...

check if a string Y is a substring of another string X

```Java
public static boolean substringMatch ( String X, String Y ) {
  for (int i = 0; i < X.length(); i++ ) {
    boolean matched = true;
    for (int j = 0; j < Y.length(); j++) {
      if (i+j >= X.length()) {
        matched = false;
        break;
      }
      if ( X.charAt(i+j) != Y.charAt(j) )
        matched = false;
    }
    if (matched) return true;
  }
  return false;
}
```
--

.big[O(X.length * Y.length)]

(Note: there are more efficient solutions.
We will discuss them later in the semester. )

    }
    if (matched) return true;
  }
  return false;
}
```

Can we reduce the time further? ( constant factor optimization )
--
<br>Yes, add
<br>`    if (!matched) break;       `<br>
as the last statement in the inner for loop

---
## Constant factor optimization

- good in practice

- may or may not make significant improvements for
problems you encounter in this class

## Rule of Thumb:
## Complexity and Actual Time

| N | worst algorithm to pass on OJ |
|:---|:---|
| <= 10 | $O(n!)$, $O(n^6)$ |
| <=[15 .. 18 ] | $O(2^n * n^2)$ |
| <=[18 .. 22 ] | $O(2^n * n)$ |
| <= 100 | $O(n^4)$ !!! |
| <= 400 | $O(n^3)$ |
| <= 2K | $O(n^2 \log n)$ |
| < 10K | $O(n^2)$  !!! |
| <= 1M | $O(n \log n)$ |
| <= 100M | $O(n)$   !!! , $O(\log n)$, $O(1)$ |

# Data Types and Their Representation

---

## Data Types

All data represented as binary in hardware.

Primitive types:

|type| size|
|---|---|
|`boolean` (in C), `char` (in C/C++)| 1 byte |
|`short`, `char` (in Java) | 2 bytes |
|`int`, `float` | 4 bytes|
|`long`, `double` | 8 bytes |

--

String

- not a primitive type
- stored as an array of characters
- WARNING: comparing two strings for equality is NOT constant time

---

## Binary Representation of Integers

- use of base-2

- binary to decimal
  - $(101)_2 = 1 \times 2^2 + 0 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 2^0 = 5$
  - $(11010)_2 = 1 \times 2^4 + 1 \times 2^3 + 0 \times 2^2 + 1 \times 2^1 + 0 \times 2^0 = 26$

- decimal to binary: mod by 2, record the remainder, divide by 2, and finally reverse the resulting string
  - `26 % 2 = 0 ` &nbsp; ` 26 / 2 = 13 `
  - `13 % 2 = 1 ` &nbsp; ` 13 / 2 = 6 `
  - ` 6 % 2 = 0 ` &nbsp; `  6 / 2 =  3 `
  - ` 3 % 2 = 1 ` &nbsp; `  3 / 2 =  1 `
  - ` 1 % 2 = 1 ` &nbsp; `  1 / 2 =  0 `

---

## Use of other bases

__Base 3__

  - $(201)_3 = 2 \times 3^2 + 0 \times 3^1 + 1 \times 3^0 = 19$

__Base 9__

  - $(480)_9 = 4 \times 9^2 + 8 \times 9^1 + 0 \times 9^0 = 396$

__Base 16__

  - ...

---
## Largest/Smallest  value with N bits

- A type using 4-bits can represent integers $(0000)_2$ to $(1111)_2$


- __Non-negative numbers__: a type using N-bits can represent values in the
range $[0, 2^N)$ <br>
  - upperbound is NOT included
  - this assumes that we represent only non-negative values


- __Negative numbers__: a type using N-bits can represent values in
the range $[-2^{N-1}, 2^{N-1})$ <br>
  - upperbound is NOT included
  - the leading bit is associated with a negative multiplier


__For signed numbers the limit on the `int` is $2^{31}-1 = 2,147,483,647$ <br>(or approximately
$2\times 10^9)$.__

---
## ASCII/UTF-8 and `char` type

- characters are just numbers that use fewer bits (8 bits or 16 bits)

- each character has a corresponding numerical value
  - 'a' = 97
  - 'A' = 65
  - '2' = 50
  - '!' = 33

- this comes in handy when comparing strings or processing characters for other
purposes

- but be careful about lexicographical ordering
  - "aaa" < "ab"
  - "AAA" < "aaa"
  - "ZZZ" < "aaa"
  - "10" < "100"
  - "2000" < "30"

## Challenge: Split a Number

We define the operation of splitting a binary number `n` into two numbers `a(n)`
and  `b(n)` as follows.
Let $0 \leq i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_k$  be the indices of the bits (with the least
significant bit having index 0) in `n` that are 1. Then the indices of the bits
of `a(n)` that are 1 are $i_1$, $i_3$, $i_5$, ... and the indices of the bits of
 `b(n)` that are 1 are $i_2$, $i_4$, $i_6$, ...

For example, if `n` is `110110101` in binary then, again in binary, `a = 010010001` and `b= 100100100`.

.left-column2-large[
__Input__

The input consists of a single integer `n` between `1` and $2^{31} - 1$ written in standard decimal (base 10) format on a single line.

__Output__

The output consists of a single line, containing the integers `a(n)` and `b(n)` separated
by a single space. Both `a(n)` and `b(n)` should be written in decimal format.

## Challenge: Split a Number

In pairs,

- make sure that __you understand how the output values are obtained from the input__
  (try all examples by hand)
- create two new test cases (input and output pairs) that are for some reason interesting,
    - restriction: they need to be values > 2000
    - try to come up with a test case that is likely to be different than those of
    other students around you


- work together to try to come up with a solution (an algorithm) for the problem
(DO NOT WRITE ACTUAL CODE)
