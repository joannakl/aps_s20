## Making change - revisited

__Task__: Given a set of coin denominations construct a given value using as
few coins as possible.

- `C = {c1, c2, c3, ..., cK}`  set of coin denomination (assume we have unlimited number of each)

- `N` amount of money that we need to come up with


- (Recall that greedy strategy does not always work.)

--

What is the __recurrence relation__ for this problem?

--

- relation:

  $ coins(N) = \min_{k=0}^{K}{ coins(N-c_k)} + 1$

- base case(s):

  $ coins(0) = 0 $

  $ coins(c_k) = 1 $

---
## Making change with backtracking

- We need to perform a complete search (with backtracking) to find the solution to this problem.

    - consider a function `coins` that given the amount of money and a set of
    denominations returns the mininum number of coins that one could use to make the change
    - calling `coins(N)` will solve our problem

        ```
        coins( n )
            if  n < 0   return INF   // solution is not possible
            if  n == 0  return 0     // all money used, we found a solution

            best = INF
            for all c in C
                best = min ( best ,  coins(n-c) + 1)

            return best
        ```

    - this function may make a lot of repeated calls with the same parameter
]

---


## Making change with DP (top-down)

- in dynamic programming we will save the results of each of the recursive calls in a table
to avoid making repeated computation
    ```
    answer = a 1D array of (N+1) elements intialized to -1

    coins( n )
        if  n < 0   return INF   // solution is not possible
        if  n == 0              // all money used, we found a solution
            answer[0] = 0
            return 0

        if answer[n] >= 0  return answer[n]

        //otherwise, compute it ...
        best = INF
        for all c in C
            best = min ( best ,  coins(n-c) + 1)

        //... and store it in the answer table
        answer[n] = best

        return best
    ```

- this guarantees that the function is called recursively at most N times (each
call fills in one of the values in the `answer` array)

## Making change with DP (bottom-up)

- we can compute the same using an iterative approach
that constructs the solution from the bottom (bottom-up approach)

- what will the algorith for this look like?

.hidden[
    ```
    answer = a 1D array of (N+1) elements
    answer[0] = 0

    for n in 1 .. N
        answer[n] = INF
        for all c in C
            if n-c >= 0
                answer[n] = min ( answer[n] ,  answer[n-c] + 1)
    ```

## No Change Problem

---

## No Change

Given
- N coins C={c0, c1, c2, ..., c(N-1)},  N < 100, ci <= 10,000,
- M desired amount, M <= 10,000
- sum of all coins >= M

Task: Find the minimum amount >= M that can be created using as few coins as possible.


---

## No Change, Attempt 1

We have two objectives:
- minimize the amount
- minimize the number of coins

Can we solve this problem one objective at a time?
--

- ignore the number of coins, try to find the smallest amount A >= M that
satisfies this problem
- once we have the amount, find the smallest number of coins that can be used
to construct A


--

__Part1__ minimize the amount A >= M that we need to spend, `min_amount(0,0)`
```
min_amount( index, val )  = min (
                        min_amount(index+1, val + C[index]),  // use C[index]
                        min_amount(index+1, val )             // do not use C[index]
                    )


min_amount(index, val >= M ) = val    // we have the amount, no use to add any more coins

min_amount(index=N, val) = INF        // reached one coin after last and did not reach
                                      // the amount, cannot be done given the choice we made to
                                      // get to this point

```

--

Practical question for implementation: so how large can `val` be?


---

## No Change, Attempt 1

We have two objectives:
- minimize the amount
- minimize the number of coins

Can we solve this problem one objective at a time?


- ignore the number of coins, try to find the smallest amount A >= M that
satisfies this problem
- once we have the amount, find the smallest number of coins that can be used
to construct A




__Part2__ given the amount A what is the smallest number of coins that we need to use, `min_coins(0, A)`
```
min_coins( index, val )  = min (
                        min_coins(index+1, val - C[index]) + 1,  // use C[index]
                        min_coins(index+1, val )             // do not use C[index]
                    )

min_coins(index, val=0) = 0         //we got the desired amount

min_coins(index, val < 0 ) = INF    //too little

min_coins(index=N, val) = INF       //rejected too many coins on the way

```

---

```

int ansA[20100][110];  //initialized to -1
int * denoms ;   //coin array

int solveAmount(int* denoms, int n, int index, int total, int sum) {

    if (sum >= total)  return sum;
    if (index == n) return INT_MAX;


    int a = ansA[sum+denoms[index]][index+1] != -1
            ? ansA[sum+denoms[index]][index+1]
            : solveAmount(denoms, n, index+1, total, sum+denoms[index]);

    int b = ansA[sum][index+1] != -1
            ? ansA[sum][index+1]
            : solveAmount(denoms, n, index+1, total, sum);

    ansA[sum][index] = (a < b) ? a : b;
    //int c = (a < b) ? a : b;
    return ansA[sum][index] ;
}

int solveCount(int* denoms, int n, int index, int total, int used) {
    if (total == 0) return used;
    if (total < 0 || index == n) return INT_MAX;
    int a = solveCount(denoms, n, index+1, total-denoms[index], used+1);
    int b = solveCount(denoms, n, index+1, total, used);
    int c = (a < b) ? a : b;
    return c;
}

## No Change, Attempt 2

In the previous example, after finding that 6 is the smallest amount, we have to run another
algorithm that figures out the number of coins to be used.

- could we store _different_ type of information in that table, so that we do not need the second
run?

---

`answers[N+1][M2]` - for each amount 0-M2 stores the number of coins needed to obtain that
amount or -1, if we do not need that value (M2 is the max possible value that we need to pay)

assume the array of coins C is indexed starting at 1

--

```
initialize `answers` array to all -1
set answers[0][0] = 0   since we need zero coins to obtain the value of 0
```
--
```
//populate the table with possible coin counts for different values
for i in 1..N
  for m in 1 .. M2
    if answers[i-1][m] > -1
      answers[i][m] = answers[i-1][m]
      answers[i][m+C[i]] =  answers[i-1][m] + 1
```
--
```
// find the first value >= M for which the column has positive entries
A=-1
for m in M .. M2
    for i in 1 .. N
        if answers[m][i] > -1
          A = m   ;    break
```
--
```
//find the smallest number of coins for A
min_coins = INF
for i in 1 .. N
    if answers[A][i] != -1 and answers[A][i] < min_coins
      min_coins = answers[A][i]

```
--
.small[the above algorithm makes accesses to out-of-bound indexes, this needs to be taken
care of in the actual code]

## No Change, Attempt 3

In the previous attempt, it seems that all the relevant information is actually in the last
row of the table.

- can we use 1D array instead?

--

`answers[M2]` stores the smallest number of coints needed for each amount in the range 0...M2

```
set all values in answers to INF

set answers[0] to 0

//populate the table with possible coin counts for different values
for i in 1..N
  for m in M2..i
    if answers[m-i] < INF and answers[m-i]+1 < answers[m]
      answers[m] = answers[m-i] + 1

//find the first non INF entry >= M
min_coins = INF
A = INF
for m in M .. M2
  if answers[m] < INF
    min_coins = answers[m]
    A = m
```

.small[the above algorithm makes accesses to out-of-bound indexes, this needs to be taken
care of in the actual code]
