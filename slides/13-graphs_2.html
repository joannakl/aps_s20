## Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP))

Task: Given a starting node, find the shortest path from that node to every other node
in the graph.

--

- If the graph is __unweighted__, then the shortest path between any two nodes is the one
with fewest edges. The algortihm uses slightly modified BFS traversal.

  algorithm using the adjacency list of a graph, O(n+m)

  ```
  visited[N] - boolean array with all values set initially to false
  distance[N] - distance array initialized to infinity
  queue      - to store nodes to be visited
  bfs ( start )
    visited [ start ] = true
    distance[ start ] = 0
    queue.push( start )
    while queue is not empty
        node = queue.pop
        for n in adj( node )
            distance[ n ] = distance[node]+1
            if ! visited[n]
                visited [n] = true
                queue.push( n )
  ```

## Shortest Path Problem

Task: Given a starting node, find the shortest path from that node to every other node
in the graph.



- If the graph is __weighted__, then the shortest path between any two nodes is the one
with smallest sum of weights along all possible paths between these two nodes. The algorithm depends
on the characteristics of the wights:

  - are there negative weights?
  - are there negative cycles?

---

## Bellman-Ford Algorithm

Algorithm using the edge list:

```
V = the set of all the nodes, |V|=n
E = the edge list consisting of tripples {a, b, w}
    (nodes a, b with the edge between them of wifth w)
distance[1..n] = INF   //initialize the distance array to infinity
x = starting vertex

distance[x] = 0
for v in V
    for  e in E
        distance[e.b] = min( distance[e.b],  distance[e.a] + e.w )
```

- O(nm)

- works as long as the graph does not have negative cycles (negative edges are ok)

- the performance can be improved by stopping as soon as there are no changes (instead
of repeating the outer loop n times)

---

Apply the Bellman-Ford Algorith. Show the content of the `distance` array as
it changes through the iterations (after each iteration of the outer loop).


---

## Bellman-Ford Algorithm - Negative Cycles



Algorithm for detecting negative cycles:

```
1. run Bellman-Ford algorithm n times
2. if the n+1 round reduces any paths, then the graph has a negative cycle
```

- this uses the fact that with a negative cycle the shortest path can
be reduced infinitely many times; the shortest path is not meaningful

---
## Dijkstra's Algorith


Algorithm using adjacency list:

`adj[a]` -  adjacency list containing pairs `{w,b}`: there is
an edge between `a` and `b` with weight `w` <br>
`distance[1..n] = INF`   - initialize the distance array to infinity<br>
`visited[1..n] = false`  - initialize visited to false<br>
`q`  a priority queue containing pairs `{-d, a}` indicating that the
current distance of node `a` from `x` is `d`  (assumes pq is implemented using a max heap)<br>
`x` - starting vertex

```

distance[x] = 0
q.push ( {0,x} )

while q is not empty
  {d,a} = q.pop()
  if visited[a]   continue
  visited[a] = true
  for  u in  adj[a]
    if distance[a]+u.w < distance[u.b]
      distance[u.b] = distance[a] + u.w
      q.push( { -distance[u.b], u.b} )

```
- O(n + m log m) - since the algorithm goes through all nodes and each node is
added to the priority queue at most once

- does not work if a graph contains negative edges

## All Pairs Shortest Path

Task: Find the length of the shortest path between ALL pairs of nodes in the graph.

--

__Floyd-Warshall Algorithm__ creates a matrix that stores the shortest paths between
all pairs of nodes.

- the algorithm starts with the adjacency matrix to initialize the final matrix with
values of all the edges and sets all other distances to infinity or zero
- the algorithm then iterates over all nodes and uses them to _shorten_ the existing path lengths
- works for directed and undirected graphs

---

## Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

  ```
  adj[n][n] - adjacency matrix for n node graph with zero indicating that there
              is not edge between the nodes
  dist[n][n] - desired distance array for all pairs of nodes

  // initialize dist matrix with values of edges and infinity
  for i in 1..n
    for j in 1..n
      if ( i == j )         dist[i][j] = 0
      else if  adj[i][j]    dist[i][j] = adj[i][j]
      else                  dist[i][j] = INF

  //shorten all paths
  for k = 1..n          //use node k to shorten the paths
    for i = 1..n
      for j = 1..n
        dist[i][j] = min (  dist[i][j],  dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]  )

  ```
.small[The innermost loop can be shortened for undirected graphs because we have
symmetry in the matrix.]

## ??? Degrees of Separation

<!-- UVA 821 Page Hopping -->

__Six degrees of separation__ is the idea that all people are six, or fewer,
social connections away from each other.

Priya is a CS web minor and she just learned about creating links from one page
to another. She is curious what the degree of separation for web-pages is.

She wrote a proposal to one of the major search engines and they happily provided
her with a list of all the links on the web-pages that their crawlers discovered.
For simplicity (and because the actual web-pages are irrelevant to Priya, they
converted all page web addresses to numbers). This way the list of links can be presented
as pairs of integers<br>
`  a b` means that page numbered `a` has a link to page numbered `b`.

--

__Input__

The input consists of multiple pairs of numbers as described above.

__Output__

The average number of links between web-pages (display it with 3 decimal digits).

__Example__

```
1 2   2 4   4 3   1 3    3 1
```


.right-column2[

]

There are 12 pairs of nodes (since the direction matters).

We have the following distances:

- from 1 to 2, 3, and 4: 1, 1, 2
- from 2 to 1, 3, and 4: 3, 2, 1
- from 3 to 1, 2, and 4: 1, 2, 3
- from 4 to 1, 2, and 3: 2, 1, 3

The total of all distances is 22 and the average all 12 pairs is 1.833.
