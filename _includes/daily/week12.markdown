### Assignment

Due Wednesday, April 28:
- provide feedback and comments for the presentations done on April 21 and April 22
(your comments should be about the presentation itself and the proposed solutions;
they should be made under the Ed post created by the presenter)


Ongoing:
- participate in outside online competitions (make sure to register and complete
this [form](https://forms.gle/h4Lb5faESmUsUybE8) before the actual contest)
- comment and ask questions about solutions for the online contest problems made by other students

__You need to participate in a _live_ contest, not one that happened in the past and still allows for virtual participation.__
